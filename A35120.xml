            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER</head>
            <p>
               <hi>AS the fining Pot for Silver</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>ſo is a Man to his Praiſe; but as a waſh-pot to the Filth, ſo is an evil Man to his Shame. William Haworth's</hi> Book of twenty four Sheets is as this waſh-pot, which is filled with the Filth of Scoffs, Slanders, Falſhoods, Contradictions and Confuſions, as by this Rejoynder is made manifeſt; Unhappy Man, that is a <hi>Ham</hi> to himſelf, and a <hi>Judas</hi> to that Truth which once he taſted.</p>
            <p>For rebuking his Rebellion, and reproving his hard Language, he hath fallen upon me, as the Men of <hi>Sodom</hi> did upon righteous <hi>Lot,</hi> for ſeeking to ſtop and turn him, as the juſt Man did his Neighbours from the Way of their Wickedneſs: But he being impatient of all Admonition (for that Cauſe) hath abuſively called we Knave, Jugler, Cheat, Mountebank, &amp;c. as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> preſſed ſore upon the Man, even <hi>Lot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (as one ſaith) when Men are reſolved to walk in the Sparks of their own kindling, and ſhall not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but vilifie and ſcorn the Admonitions of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by what Hand ſoever adminiſtred, it is a Sign that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40871:3"/> Deſtruction is coming upon them like an armed Man; and it is ſaid of <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phyneas</hi> the Prieſts, <hi>That they hearkened not to the Voice of their Father, becauſe the Lord would ſlay them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But my Adverſary reads and underſtands the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as ſome Men do Acts of Oblivion and general Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, who are apt to conclude all are pardoned, and there is no Danger now of being called in Queſtion, &amp;c. But the more conſiderate Reader diligently ſearches and peruſeth the Exceptions and Conditions of ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges, leſt they ſhould both deceive themſelves, and thoſe that are apt to be too credulous of ſuch Reports.</p>
            <p>I was willing his Book ſhould have dyed of it ſelf (not expecting my Silence would have been interrupted, as I find it is) (1<hi>ſt</hi>) Becauſe it is ſo confuſed and void of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod as well as Matter: (2<hi>dly</hi>) Becauſe it's hard to be diſtinguiſhed whoſe Words they are, mine or his, being oft times both in the ſame Charaſter, whether out of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or Deſign, let the Reader judge: (3<hi>dly</hi>) There is nothing new in it, but what hath been anſwered over and over, though mannaged by abler Adverſaries then <hi>W. Haworth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But being of late informed of a 3<hi>d</hi> and 4<hi>th</hi> Book of his which ſince I hear are both anſwered by others, where he ſeems to boaſt, that he hath one whole Book which lyes at our Doors unanſwered; and further ſaith, <hi>Let them reply if they will or dare;</hi> all which I could have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by, knowing the Temper of the Man; but for the ſake of ſome that are apt to value Men beyond their Worth, and then to have their Faith with Reſpect to thoſe mens Perſons; and others that intend well, but are ſo frighted
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40871:3"/> by great Words and hardned Confidence, that they dare not truſt their own Experience; and alſo being importaned thereunto upon <hi>William Haworth</hi>'s perſiſting in his cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Abuſes, I have at laſt made publick this Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which hath been prepared and layn by me above a Years Time.</p>
            <p>Our Book called <hi>Rebellion rebuked</hi> contain'd between ſix and ſeven Sheets, about ten Moneths after the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ours comes forth <hi>W. Haworth</hi>'s Reply to it of twenty four Sheets, which according to his Multiplication of Time and Paper, our Rejoynder ſhould be about eighty Sheets of Paper, and we three full Years about it.</p>
            <p>But knowing much better how to ſpend our Time, I have (though briefly) replyed to moſt of the Pages of the firſt Part under theſe three Heads, viz. 1, <hi>Title Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> 2, <hi>Scoffs and Scorns;</hi> 3. <hi>Contradictions and Confuſions;</hi> under ſome of theſe Heads the Reader may find whatever ſeems to have Weight in it.</p>
            <p>My Purpoſe is not (by Epiſtle) much longer to detain the Reader; <hi>William Haworth</hi> began to caſt the firſt Stone, and perſues that Work like thoſe that winked with their Eyes, and ran upon <hi>Steven,</hi> whom nothing could appeaſe but that Martyr's Blood.</p>
            <p>My Delight is not in Contention, but in Peace; but when men. <hi>Gehazi</hi>-like, will riſe up againſt the Spirit of their Master (whom they pretend to ſerve) ſaying as he did, <hi>My Maſter hath ſpared</hi> Naaman <hi>this</hi> Syrian, <hi>but as the Lord liveth, I will run after him, and take ſomewhat of him, &amp;c.</hi> we cannot but reprove them, as <hi>Eliſha</hi> did; for as the precious Sons of <hi>Sion</hi> are compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to fine Gold, ſo the Scripture alſo affirms, <hi>God ſhall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40871:4"/> caſt away the wicked as Droſs;</hi> and further ſaith, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate Silver ſhall men call them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I deſire the Reader in his Peruſal of this Reply to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Particulars following.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That although I have made Uſe of ſome few Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations out of our own Country-men, yet I do not ſay but they differed from us in ſome other Things.</item>
               <item>2. When thou ſhalt find the Antecedency or Precedency of the Spirit of God pleaded for, it is not intended in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or Contempt of the holy Scriptures, but as that which muſt be firſt received and relyed upon, to give the true and right Underſtanding of them.</item>
               <item>3. When thou readeſt me pleading for the Light of Chriſt in every man, it is not to advance ny natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility without this ſupernatural Aid, but that Obedience may be yielded to the Requirings of this Light, whereby it doth prove its own Sufficiency in diſcovering and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting Self in Man, that by the daily Denyal thereof, we may become the Diſciples of Chriſt.</item>
               <item>4. When my Adverſary cites Scriptures for to oppoſe Juſtification to Sanctification, or to plead for Justification without VVorks of Sanctification, and I gainſay him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, it is becauſe the Scriptures in that Caſe only deny their Merit to justifie without Chriſt.</item>
               <item>5. When thou findeſt me pleading the Neceſſity of good Works in juſtified Perſons, it is only according to that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40871:4"/> Maxim (<hi>non propter, ſed ſecundum</hi>) <hi>i. e.</hi> not for them as meritours, but according to them, as that which God hath joyned together, and no man ought to put them aſſunder.</item>
               <item>6. When thou obſerveſt me oppoſing my Adverſary's Imputation of Righteouſneſs, it is not becauſe I deny imputed Righteouſneſs, but his Application of it to the Ungodly, while in their Ungodlineſs, contrary to 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.7. <hi>Little Children let no Man deceive you, he that doth Righteouſneſs is righteous even as Chriſt is righteous.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>7. When thou findeſt me affirming (in Contradiction to my Adverſary) that if the firſt riſing to Evil be the Sin of unconſenting Perſons, that judges and denies them; then (I ſay) it's no matter who conſents or who denies, if he that denies ſinneth, as well as he that conſents; and yet I do not deny inward motions to Sin to be evil in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I deſire the Reader to obſerve throughout this whole Book this Agreement between my Adverſary and I, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>That the true Knowledge of the Doctrines in Controverſie muſt be inwardly taught by the Spirit,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 66. <hi>And both in our Preachings and Writings</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we are for an experimental ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Knowledge of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> So that when either of us ſpeak of Chriſt, thou art to underſtand it of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and experimental Knowledge of Chriſt, and the like thou art to underſtand of Faith &amp; Juſtification, &amp;c.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40871:5"/> they muſt be all inwardly taught by the Spirit, that our Knowledge may be experimental and ſpiritual, elſe it is but dogmatical and hiſtorical, <hi>which</hi> (ſaith my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, <hi>p.</hi> 66.) <hi>is not ſufficient for Salvation.</hi> Theſe Things being diligently obſerved may both help the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and in a great meaſure put an End to all Contention between us and our Adverſaries.</p>

Haworth, <hi>That Meeting was beneficial to us by Reaſon of a Conceſſion from thee at that time,</hi> viz. <hi>That the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was an higher thing then the Light within, and you did but point out People to the Light, in order to the New Creature,</hi> Epiſt. pag. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> If by a higher Thing thou intendſt a further State then a bare having of the Light, or then the firſt believing in it (if ſo) then I affirm the ſame ſtill; and the End of our directing People to the Light [is] that they might be new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Babes, and Children of Light, by believing in it: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the bare believing that there is ſuch a Light, and that they have it, will not be ſufficient for them, except they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated by it. I hope, when you meet with this, it will be as beneficial as that Meeting thou ſpeakeſt of. But then, <hi>William,</hi> thou muſt repent of calling the Light a <hi>rotten, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40871:6"/> and unſound Thing,</hi> and of ſaying, thou <hi>ſcarce knoweſt one Goſpel truth but it contradicts,</hi> pag. 149. and pag. ibid.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>I have heard thee my ſelf ſay, He brought his Son out of</hi> Egypt (<hi>i. e.</hi>) <hi>out of the Egyptian-darkneſs of our hearts: Doth not this take off from the Hiſtory?</hi> Epiſt. p. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> No more then thoſe words, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. <hi>Seeing they crucified again to themſelves the Son of God, &amp;c.</hi> do take off from the Hiſtory of his being <hi>crucified without the Gates of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Jeruſalem;</hi> &amp; <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.8. there is inward or <hi>ſpiritual Egypt and Sodom,</hi> ſpoken of, where alſo our <hi>Lord was crucified:</hi> And is there not Darkneſs in that <hi>Egypt?</hi> Oh, <hi>William!</hi> the Reaſon why thou art ſuch a Stranger to theſe things, is becauſe <hi>Nullum elimentum in ſuo loco graveſcitur;</hi> He that is in Union with thick Darkneſs, feels not the Miſery and Pain of it.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>That Work of the Spirit in our Hearts is not God's, Son, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> Thou ſpeakeſt indiffinitely, as if the Work of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in our hearts was in no ſenſe in <hi>Scripture</hi> called <hi>God's Son,</hi> contrary to the Apoſtle's <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> Gal. 1.16. <hi>When it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to reveal his Son in me.</hi> Was not this the Work of the Spirit in the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s heart, &amp;c?</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>But this is not ſo bad as to ſay, the Only-begotten Son, begotten in us, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>

               <p>Haworth, <hi>I have been an hundred times hurried into your Way and Opinions, like a Child toſſed to and fro with every Wind of Doctrine; but I am brought now to a conſiſtency and fixedneſs,</hi> Epiſt. p. 12, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> Or Way is the Light, and they that walk in it are out of all Hurries and Toſſings; and for Opinions, thou art no now hurried amongſt them, and toſſed one while upon Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, and another while upon Self-contradiction; and for the <hi>conſiſtency</hi> and <hi>fixedneſs</hi> thou ſpeakeſt of, I refer the Reader

               <p>Haworth, <hi>Thou art the dearer to us,</hi> John, <hi>that thou haſt been once a Stone in Chriſt's Building,</hi> Epiſt. p 12, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Haworth, <hi>Some of old pretended they were ſent to preach the Everlaſting Goſpel, in oppoſition to the old Goſpel. In the</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations <hi>ſome are ſpoken of, that talked of the Depths which</hi> John <hi>adds Satan to: This hath been my Temptation, and am confident is thine now,</hi> Epiſt. p 12, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> We may in our time (without Antiquity) find out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny preaching another or new Goſpel that yet pretend highly to the Old, like thoſe <hi>falſe Teachers</hi> that were ſo ſtiff for outward things, in oppoſition to that Spirit the <hi>Galatians</hi> (that <hi>began well</hi>) began in; and doubtleſs this is one of the Depths of Satan, to draw the Mind from the Light of the Spirit within. And I do believe thee, that as it was, ſo it is ſtill, <hi>thy Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to oppoſe the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> under colour, that thou knoweſt not <hi>one Goſpel-truth but the Light within contradicts,</hi> as thou ſayeſt: And for thy Confidence, its but like to thy <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency</hi> and <hi>fixedneſs.</hi> But I will aſſure thee, I neither <hi>itch</hi> to be a <hi>Doctor of Allegories,</hi> nor yet to exerciſe my ſelf in things <hi>too high for me;</hi> Glory to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s God, who hath weaned me from it. Therefore take heed of thy Confidence, for elſe it will deceive thee, to the Ruin of thy Soul.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>The Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation be upon thee while thou art reading theſe following Lines, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> Haſt thou ſuch a high Conceit of thy own Writings
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40871:7"/> that they cannot be underſtood without divine Revelation, and ye denyes the Antecedency of the <hi>Spirit and Light of Chriſt within,</hi> to be neceſſary to the true underſtanding of the holy Scriptures, and the Myſteries of God therein mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>In vain was that Revelation of the Everlaſting Goſpel to</hi> Adam, <hi>if the Light within would have ſhewed it,</hi> Book, p. 4, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> In vain had that Revelation been, if <hi>Adam</hi> had not had ſome <hi>Light within,</hi> to ſee what was tendred and made known to him.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>Let us ſee what Faith it was that theſe departed from in</hi> 1 Tim. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> Inſtead of ſhe wing what <hi>Faith</hi> they departed from, thou (either ignorantly or wilfully) takeſt up the time about the Faith they turned to, and imbraced after their departure, which is nothing to the purpoſe; for my words are theſe, <hi>And others departed from that Faith which</hi> Paul <hi>exhorts</hi> Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>to hold faſt,</hi> in Oppoſition to thy aſſerting it impoſſible to forſake the <hi>Goſpel, being once truly received.</hi> And thus, like the Horſe mumbling the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Haworth, <hi>Thou hadſt better not named that Scripture, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> It had better for thee indeed that I had neither <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it,</hi> nor thou gone about to anſwer it; for then hadſt thou ſaved thy Credit.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>God's eſſential Power cannot be communicated; for then would the Creature, to whom it is communicated, be Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent,</hi> Book, p. 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> Who would think that a man that pretends ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Scripture Rule, ſhould be ſo much beſides it, as to uſe [Terms] of Diſtinction not once named in Scripture? its ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſilence all Fleſh, that both <hi>Scripture</hi> and experienced <hi>Saints</hi> do tell us, That <hi>the Spirit it ſelf bears witneſs in them,</hi> and that they were made <hi>Partakers of the Divine Nature and Power of God,</hi> whereby they were <hi>more then Conquerors, and

               <p>Haworth, <hi>Either thou haſt forgotten that this Phraſe, which I make uſe of, was ever uſed by</hi> Paul, Gal 4.19. <hi>or elſe thou doſt plainly gibe at the Apoſtle and Church of</hi> Galatians, <hi>at leaſt through our Sides thou woundeſt them; they had ſome Knowledge of Chriſt, but it was too confuſed and dim,</hi> p 10, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> I very well remembred the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s words in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t find no ſuch words as [<hi>diſtinctly</hi>] formed in you; [<hi>dim and too confuſed</hi>] are imaginary words of thy own coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> could be <hi>formed</hi> in a man, and yet that man in whom he is ſo <hi>formed,</hi> either to be wholely ignorant of it, or ſo confuſed and dim that he is unable to diſting iſh it from any thing elſe; ſo that this Falſhood and Confuſion may be added to the reſt; for I neither forgot the Place, nor yet gibe at the <hi>Apoſtle:</hi> Neither do I believe, that either the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> and thy ſelf, or the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Galatia</hi> and thy <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Hartford</hi> to be in ſuch Union, that the hitting of you muſt needs wound them through your ſides.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>Now,</hi> John, <hi>is this Language becoming thee, viz.</hi> Paul, <hi>what is thy Labour and Travail worth, whenas thou haſt not brought the</hi> Galatians <hi>to have Chriſt formed in them? And,</hi> Paul, <hi>what a Church is this Church thou writeſt to in</hi> Galatia? <hi>and what a Paſtor, Preacher and Apoſtle art thou? and what dear Brethren are they to thee, &amp;c?</hi> p 10, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> Thou art like him that makes a Man of Straw, and then to ſhew his Valour fights with it. Thou knoweſt I uſe no ſuch Language to <hi>Paul,</hi> nor the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Galatia</hi> in my whole Book; but thou, like a man having loſt his way, pryes into every Turning to recover his Loſs, yet the more he goes on the further he is out of his Way: But why doſt thou plead for mixt Communions with ſuch as are turned to another Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, whom the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls <hi>bewitched and fooliſh,</hi> and thought to be made <hi>perfect by the Fleſh,</hi> being <hi>removed from the Grace and Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> into which he begat them at the firſt, when they <hi>began well,</hi> and therefore his <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Travail</hi> was both of <hi>Worth and Value,</hi> and not in vain, as thine and others
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40871:8"/> are at this day, who like thoſe falſe <hi>Teacher</hi> (the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks againſt) do but make Work for the true Labourers to travail in Birth again, to recover your Proſelytes out of thoſe outward things and forms, to have Chriſt truly formed in them, that neither the people themſelves, nor the true Miniſters, may be perplexed, or ſtand in doubt of them, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.20. But whither art thou going, Friend? Is thy pleading for ſuch mixt communion the way to be a Paſtor of a ſeparate Church at <hi>Hartford,</hi> or to be a Pariſh Prieſt again? Think not that this turning will ſet thee right (<hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the Apoſtle calls the <hi>Galatians Little Children</hi> and <hi>Brethren.</hi> &amp;c. for theſe and ſuch like are but amicable terms, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed in Scripture, and doth not alwayes imply them ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be <hi>Children</hi> in a ſpiritual Senſe, and <hi>Brethren</hi> in the true Goſpel-Brotherhood; as, Chriſt calling him <hi>Friend</hi> that had not on the Wedding-Garment, and yet was not really ſo in the Senſe he calls his Diſciples (<hi>no more Servants but Friends;</hi>) and <hi>Stephen,</hi> Acts 7.2. calls the High Prieſts and Jews <hi>Men, Brethren and Fathers;</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 23.1. calls the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil <hi>Brethren, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>I'le grant, that the main Work was to preach the Goſpel, they did but preach the Law in Subſerviency to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; thus they were Miniſters not of the Letter only, for this doth but kill, but of the Spirit,</hi> p 12, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> If preaching the Law be in order to the Goſpel, to prepare the Spirit of man by convincing of Sin, and ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Soul to a welcome reception of the Grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, &amp;c. as thou affirmeſt, p. 11. then why is it not as main a work to preach the Law? or is there a way to Salvation from Sin, without being firſt convinced of Sin, &amp;c? But let the Readers obſerve how thou ſwarveſt that from thy Rule (thou pleadeſt ſo much for) <hi>Subſerviency</hi> is a term not uſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and beſides thou addeſt the word [<hi>Only</hi>] for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Able Miniſters, not of the Letter,</hi> and thou addeſt [<hi>Only</hi>] which is an Addition to Scripture; but in further Confuſion and to thy own Conſutation, thou makes Chriſt the Author of both, ſaying, <hi>He wounds at well as heals, &amp; kills as well as makes alive;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40871:8"/> the one he doth by the preaching of the Law, the other by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel:</hi> Doth not this prove Law and Goſpel to be one in their End and Nature, for which thou taunteſt ſo much at me, and ſpendeſt the whole 13th page by way of Deriſion, ſaying, <hi>It will coſt me ſome Sweat to untye this Knot, &amp;c.</hi> But before thou art aware thou haſt done it. For if it be Chriſt that kills by the Law (as thou ſayeſt) and Chriſt that makes alive by the Goſpel: Is not [he] one and the ſame, and is not his End the ſame, like a wiſe <hi>Phyſician</hi> to cure and reſtore his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient?</p>

                  <hi>Crook,</hi> And is not the Goſpel ſo too? What is it this man quarrels with? is it not written, <hi>The Miniſtration of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is glorious, but the Miniſtration of the Spirit exceeds in Glory?</hi> In it ſelf it is not glorious, but dreadful and terrible; but becauſe of its End, by convincing of Sin, and ſo humbling the Soul to a welcome reception of Chriſt, or the Grace of the Goſpel, as thy ſelf ſpeaks, p. 11. And the Apoſtle doth not ſay the Miniſtration of the Spirit [differed] (in Nature and Kind) but exceeded in Glory, and therefore ſaith; <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Miniſtrations,</hi> but <hi>by the ſame Lord or Spirit,</hi> pag. 11, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>Yet hitherto tends this admitting of no Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Law and Goſpel,</hi> p. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> My words are not ſo, but thus, <hi>viz. Why doſt thou divide betwixt Law and Goſpel?</hi> Surely thou art not ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as thou makeſt thy ſelf, as if there were no diffence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> and <hi>dividing.</hi> But becauſe the Scripture diſtinguiſheth between <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> therefore by thy <hi>Logick</hi> they are divided: and becauſe the Scripture di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth between <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> therefore it divides them according to thy dealing with me; for I ask, why thou <hi>divideſt</hi> between Law and Goſpel, and thou abuſeſt and perverteſt my words, as if I admitted of no <hi>Diſtinction</hi> between them: Is this ſair dealing, <hi>William Haworth?</hi> But remember for the time to come, That a Man may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> Here thou confeſſeſt, that the <hi>Spirituallity of the Law</hi> (which was the thing I affirmed to be <hi>one</hi> in <hi>End and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> with <hi>the Goſpel</hi>) to be the <hi>Spirit or Power of God,</hi> which is called <hi>the Goſpel,</hi> and is ſaid, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.12. to be <hi>A Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart,</hi> which thou ſayeſt, it doth in thee, this muſt needs be the <hi>Spirit,</hi> by thy own Acknowledgment, p. 14. calling the <hi>Law a fit Inſtrument for the Spirit to make uſe of;</hi> ſo that it's the Spirit's Work whatever is the Inſtrument; that is the <hi>Agent</hi> by thy own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment.</p>
               <p>But I perceive the Scriptures quoted by me have qualified thy Heat, page 15. ſo that now it is the Doctrine of the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> not <hi>Law</hi> [<hi>taken ſtrictly</hi>] &amp;c. but it may be called the <hi>Law,</hi> ſo it be not [<hi>taken ſtrictly</hi>] <hi>but in a mild or common Acceptation,</hi> ſo that thou haſt both made the Challenge, viz. <hi>to produce one Scripture where Law and Goſpel are Terms that ſignifie the ſame Thing,</hi> as I aſſerted (and to which thou makeſt this Challenge, and alſo undertakeſt to make it good againſt thy ſelf.)</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>My taſting of the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt was the Reaſon why I did not take up with the</hi> Quakers <hi>Chriſt, finding ſo much Sweetneſs and Comfort in the Knowledge of him crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo abhorring to believe in the Light within, as the Chriſt of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook, David</hi> invites to <hi>Taſting,</hi> as the beſt Way of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>how Good and Gracious the Lord is,</hi> Pſal. 34.9. and <hi>Paul</hi> alſo accounted <hi>the Revelation of Chriſt within to be the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 1.12,15,16. compared with <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8,10,11. <hi>And called me by his Grace to reveal

               <p>Haworth, <hi>Well, now let theſe ſtand together, and</hi> John, <hi>do thou ſpeak for thy ſelf; either theſe are no</hi> Quakers <hi>and thou diſowneſt them and their Writings, or the Light within, not Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>is the</hi> Quakers <hi>Chriſt, ſo not the Lord's Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> John <hi>thus doſt but juggle, &amp;c.

               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> The Page before is ſtuffed with railing Accuſations which have been ſufficiently ſpoke to by <hi>G. W. W. P.</hi> againſt <hi>Faldo,</hi> and <hi>I.

               <p>Haworth, <hi>This Blood and Sufferings of Chriſt, the Value of them towards God for the Expiation of the Guilt of Sin, I apply to my own Soul, that is guilty of the Breach of the Law, and have Peace hereby,</hi> Rom. 5. p. 19, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> I wonder thou ſhouldeſt ſo ſoon forget thy ſelf, who in <hi>p.</hi> 14, 15. ſayeſt, that neither <hi>Law</hi> nor <hi>Goſpel</hi> can either <hi>convince</hi> or <hi>convert</hi> without the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but as the <hi>Spirit uſeth them, being as a fit Inſtrument for the Spirit;</hi> and yet thou that haſt the <hi>Filth of Sin remaining in thee, canſt apply to thy own guilty Soul the Value of Chriſt's Blood, &amp;c. and have Peace thereby,</hi> while Chriſt told his poor Diſciples, without <hi>him</hi> they could do nothing; and the Apoſtle ſaid, it was God (<hi>by his Spirit</hi>) that made <hi>Chriſt their Righteouſneſs and Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.</hi> not their own <hi>Application</hi> of them to their <hi>guilty Souls,</hi> as thou ſpeakeſt, like a Man void of all Senſe of what thou ſayeſt, &amp;c. that <hi>Faith</hi> which gave them <hi>Peace with God, purified their Hearts, and kept Chriſt dwelling therein,</hi> as a <hi>Prince</hi> in them, <hi>being ſtronger then he that is in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>I charge thee with the higheſt Blaſphemy imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp;c. if thou doſt it knowingly and wittingly, ſuch as never ſhall be forgiven, if thou attribute any of theſe Titles</hi> (viz. <hi>Firſt-born of every Creature, the Brightneſs of his Father's Glory, the eternal Word, the Alpha and Omega, the All in all</hi>) <hi>to any Thing that is in Man, beſides the very Perſon of</hi> JESUS CHRIST, p. 19. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> The very repeating of this <hi>Paragraph and Charge</hi> is ſufficient to ſhew its Folly, and vain Boaſting of its Author, who now by his Words allows the very <hi>Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be in man, and yet ſaith p. 4. <hi>His Righteouſneſs is wholely without him,</hi> &amp;c. take his Words <hi>ſtrictly,</hi> and they import (1) that thoſe Titles mentioned by him, belong only to the <hi>Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> (2) That this <hi>Perſon</hi> is in man. (3) That 'tis <hi>Blaſphemy in the higheſt, to attribute any of thoſe Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles to any thing in man, beſides the very Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:40871:11"/> Now if he meant otherwiſe (viz) That it is the <hi>higheſt Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to attribute any of theſe Tules to any thing in man, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt without man;</hi> and alſo, that by the <hi>Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he means as he ſaith, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Eternal VVord, and firſt born of every Creature, the firſt and the laſt, the All in All, is this Perſon; then he doth not only exclude God the Father, Son and holy Spirit from being in Man, (<hi>i.e.</hi>) Saints or others, contrary to the whole Corrent of Scripture dialect; but alſo falls into the <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Opinion, <hi>viz</hi> That in Chriſt were two Perſons as well as Natures: Beſides it's Blaſphemy to limit and ſhut out the holy only One, for how is he then the All in All? is he in all, and yet muſt we be charged with Blaſphemy for conſeſſing him or his Name in his People? But further, if by the Perſon of Chriſt he intends not as he ſaith, <hi>viz.</hi> the Eternal VVord, or Deity of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Son, &amp;c. but only the prepared Body, that the Son took upon him in Time, then he doth not only vary from the Creed of a Trinity of coeternal Perſons, but alſo himſelf is guilty of Blaſphemy, in attributing thoſe Titles to the Body which properly belongs to him that took it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Eternal VVord, the only Potentate, the Alpha and Omega, the All in All, &amp;c. who was before that Body was: But if <hi>William Haworth</hi> will allow neither the Eternal VVord, nor the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born of every Creature to have any Place in Man, then what is become of his Convert to Chriſtianity, he is but a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Convert, and he and his Leader are both Aliens, without God, and without Chriſt in the VVorld.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>The Scriptures are revealed by the Apoſtles, and by the Wiſdom and Judgment of Man, enlightned by the ſame Spirit that gave them forth, we may attain the Knowledge of them, and not without,</hi> p 21. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> Thou ſpeakeſt now like a <hi>Quaker;</hi> take heed of making thy ſelf a Tranſgreſſor any more, by the denying the Neceſſity of the Light and Spirit within to underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or by condemning the <hi>Quakers</hi> for preaching the Light, in the firſt Place to give People the Knowledge both of Chriſt and Scriptures.</p>

               <p>Haworth, <hi>I ask now whether the Scriptures or our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Thoughts be the Rule, whereby we are to meaſure God and true Righteouſneſs,</hi> p. 21. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> Is thy Memory ſo bad, or thy Ignorance ſo great, to ask ſuch a Queſtion, which thy ſelf reſolveſt in the ſame Page? or art thou ſtill in thy skiptical Mind (as thou ſpeakeſt of thy ſelf) ſeeing thou ſayd'ſt but juſt before, that it muſt be by the ſame Spirit that gave forth the Scripture, that we can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, and not without; have thy Thoughts and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations ſo great, and the Spirit of God ſo little a Share in what thou doſt, which makes thee ſo ſoon forget its Uſefulneſs to meaſure divine Things; but I even tremble at thy ignorant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, to talk at this rate of meaſuring the unmeaſurable God, and that by the Scriptures, or our own Thoughts, without na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his Spirit.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>The Scripture no where condemns Man's Concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of God by the Scripture, and according to them,</hi> p. 22. &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> I know not what a great Croſs it is for a Debtor, that knows his Creditor to be fully ſatisfied, and paid his Debt (by another in his ſtead) to believe it to be ſo: But indeed it is a Croſs to be ſtumbled at, and a ſtrange thing for a poor Debtor to be told, he muſt believe his Debts are paid, and his Creditor is ſatisfied, while his Creditor keeps him ſtill in Priſon, and calls to him every Day for full Payment; this is croſs to ſound Judgment and good Underſtanding: But if this be all the Acquaintance thou haſt with the Croſs of Chriſt, I will aſſure thee thou art far enough from being his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But why doſt thou dare me <hi>William?</hi> am I all of a ſuddain changed in thy Opinion, from a Knave and a jugling Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank (as thou calleſt me) unto ſuch a tender-conſcienced Man, that I dare not ſpeak otherwiſe then I believe? who playes Tricks now <hi>William?</hi> making me believe, that if I will own what thou would'ſt have me, then thou wilt believe me; yet when I have given Teſtimony to the Blood of Chriſt, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Things, even as thy ſelf in Words profeſſeſt to believe, yet for ſo doing thou calleſt my Perſon a Knave and a Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank, and my Belief a Juggle: But thy Speech bewrayes thee,

I dare and do own, that what Chriſt ſuffered, it was for us, and that the weighty Senſe of the Miſery due to Mankind for Sin fell upon him, as the ſqueezing of Grapes in a Wine-preſs, which cauſed him to ſweat like Drops of Blood in his Agony, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. all this we believe, &amp; according to holy Scripture: But let us now conſider <hi>William Haworth</hi>'s Belief, and we ſhall find this to be one Article of his Faith, viz. <hi>That Chriſt when he ſuffered was not innocent, and as guilty God poured out all his Wrath upon him, &amp;c. Chriſt had the Guilt of Sin really charged upon him, what elſe is to be underſtood by theſe Words,</hi> viz. <hi>he was made Sin for us,</hi> Epiſt. &amp;c. which is more then I dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm; for what <hi>Job</hi> ſaid of his own Integrity may much more be teſtified of Chriſt's Innocency (to wit) <hi>That he did not let that go till he dyed, neither was Guile found in his Mouth.</hi> And whatever thine and others Conceivings are of the Sufferings of Chriſt, I dare ſay, that no Man can conceive, much leſs expreſs what they were in the deep Travail of his Soul, when he poured it out, an Offering for Sin, and the heavy Senſe of Mans Miſery fell upon him, &amp;c. only thoſe that have had Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with him in his Sufferings, and been made conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Death (in their Mealure) are his Witneſſes of what he ſuffer'd, by the good Experience he hath given them, through the Revelation of his holy Spirit in their Hearts; ſuch know ſomething of the Sufferings of Chriſt, and the Benefit of them to their own Souls, &amp;c. Yet is not the Freeneſs of Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40871:15"/> nor the free Grace and Mercy of God to Sinners deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby, that truly believe in the Light of Chriſt Jeſus, and repent of the Evils that are made manifeſt to them by the ſame; neither is the Work of Sanctification and Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by all that Chriſt hath done or ſuffered, made leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the inheriting the Kingdom of God and everlaſting Salvation; nor are the Exhortations to Men and Women, to follow Holineſs, and to work out their own Salvation with Fear and Trembling, either weakened in themſelves, or made indifferent to Believers; nor is the inward Work of redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Heart and Mind out of the World (to be fully ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on things above) by the Spirit and Power of Chriſt within to be neglected or diſeſteemed, by laying all the Streſs upon what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered without us, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For though Chriſt be both a general and particular Saviour, yet the Benefit accruing to Men by him, as the general Saviour, is known and received only where he is witneſſed a particular Saviour; for Chriſt in man becoming the Hope of Glory, and Man being changed into the ſame Image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord, is the Salvation, and the Perfection of every true Chriſtian: I have been the larger now upon this Subject, that I may be excuſed from writing any more about it in this Reply.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>He that works not, but believes,</hi> Rom. 4. <hi>There it Faith only, a bare Belief,</hi> John, <hi>what ſayeſt thou to that? though that Faith that is juſtifying, will work by Love, yet it receives no Efficacy from its being accompanied with Works, as to our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, but from the Object without,</hi> p. 29. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> I ſay, thou haſt anſwered thy ſelf, that it is not a <hi>bare</hi> Belief without Works; for thou ſayeſt, it is a <hi>working Faith;</hi> and if it were not ſo, it muſt needs be a dead <hi>Faith.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks not of a <hi>bare</hi> believing excluding its operative Nature, no more then the <hi>Apoſtle James</hi> doth of <hi>Works</hi> excluding believing, but both agree, that <hi>Juſtification is by a living working Faith:</hi> When the Apoſtle excludeth Works from Juſtification, he excludeth them only under the Notion or Conceit of Merit, in which Senſe the <hi>Jews</hi> urged the Neceſſity of them in that Buſineſs. There is no Oppoſition between Grace and Works, but a clear Conſiſtency, except or unleſs by Works we underſtand Merit.</p>
               <p>And to ſay, it receives <hi>no Efficacy from its being accompanied with Works,</hi> is little leſs in plain Engliſh, then to ſay, if it did not <hi>work,</hi> it would be as efficacious to <hi>Juſtification,</hi> which is both contrary to Scripture, and this received Doctrine (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Where Chriſt removes the Guilt of Sin, he alſo removes the Filth of Sin, Juſtification and Sanctification being inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Companions; and Juſtification is never without Sanctification;</hi> for no Perſons are the Subjects of Goſpel. Juſtification, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, or, <hi>as in their ſins,</hi> but, as being <hi>ſanctified,</hi> and the Filth of Sin removed, ſo then juſtified, not in Sin, but in the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> they being <hi>waſhed,</hi> &amp;c. according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>And ſuch were ſome of you, but ye

               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> That the Reader may bear witneſs to W.

               <p>Haworth, <hi>I had thought that Faith had been the Subſtance of things hoped for; that by Faith Chriſt dwelt in our Hearts,</hi> p. 30. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> This he ſpeaks of the imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt brought nigh, which is a large Confeſſion to the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentneſs, or Indwelling of Chriſt, and conſequently his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in the Hearts of true Believers; and that which he calls <hi>the Subſtance of things hoped for,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>is in their Hearts alſo.</hi> Now if all theſe things be ſo <hi>nigh,</hi> what is the Cauſe that W. H. and I are ſo far aſſunder?</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>This is true, plainly underſtood as ſpoken,</hi> pag. 31. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> Theſe are my Words he confeſſeth unto, ſpeaking of the <hi>Imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> which in the Fulneſs of time was manifeſt in and by him, and in due time made mine, by the Work and Application of his Spirit in my Inward Parts. This is true, ſaith W. H. So that I need take no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notice of his Cavils againſt it, ſeeing he hath ſo fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to the Truth of it.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>If this</hi> [<hi>Him</hi>] <hi>was to be underſtood of the true Chriſt, we need not one Word further,</hi> p. 32. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> My Words are (viz) And God is well pleaſed or ſatisfied in and with [<hi>Him</hi>] in whom I am accepted, &amp;c. Now I do declare it is the true Chriſt that I intended by [<hi>Him</hi>] ſo that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40871:17"/> it is needleſs for me to reply one Word further, as himſelf confeſſeth</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>Chriſt of himſelf, and his Merit is not ſufficient, unleſs ſomething wrought by the Light in us doth joyn its Merit with him,</hi> pag. 33. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> This is ſcoffingly ſpoken, in Contempt, not only of what I have ſaid, but alſo of the Works of the Spirit, as appears by his own Words (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Thou wouldſt have the Works that are wrought by the Spirit have ſome Share in Acceptation.</hi> What would this man ſay, if he durſt ſpeak plainly? as if the Spirit in its working did leſſen the worth and ſufficiency of Chriſt; or as if <hi>W. H.</hi> contemned that <hi>Ancient, Orthodox</hi> Saying (<hi>viz.</hi>) It is not <hi>propter,</hi> but <hi>ſecundum</hi> (i. e.) We are accepted, not for, nor yet without where there is a Capacity, but <hi>according to GOOD WORKS.</hi> But this man would make the works of the Spirit, and the work of Chriſt to be like <hi>Iſrael and Amalek:</hi> No Acceptation of an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> by the Merit of Chriſt unleſs the <hi>Works of the Spirit,</hi> like the Name of <hi>Amalek</hi> be quite blotted out from having any thing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>What the Lord doth, is really done, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> I Oppoſe <hi>Reallity</hi> to thy Imagination, not to any Act of God; for in the New Creation as well as the Old, God ſaith, <hi>Let it be ſo, and it is ſo:</hi> But I am jealous thou and others imagine that to be ſo which is not ſo in this great Caſe. Therefore do not deceive thy ſelf and others by calling the ſtrength of Imagination <hi>Reality,</hi> and a confident Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a <hi>Living Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>But indeed this Righteouſneſs is not at a Diſtance from us, but put upon us by the Father's Gift; Ye have put on Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.27. <hi>It is the beſt Robe put upon us, &amp;c. And all that Righteouſneſs that is within us of Sanctification, is but the Fruit of this; it was merited and purchaſed for us by this,</hi> p. 34, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> I have ſpoken to this Subject under Title <hi>Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Confuſion.</hi> The Words he ſo wars againſt are theſe, (viz.) <hi>Thou believeſt to be ſaved by a Righteouſneſs wholely without thee, Reckoned, but not Real, which Righteouſneſs
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40871:17"/> Chriſt wrought One Thouſand Six Hundred Years ſince</hi> (<hi>not that we undervalue that Righteouſneſs, nay, curſed is he that ſo doth</hi>) <hi>really no nearer to thee then the Place where he perſonally lived and dyed.</hi> Now I deſire the Reader to conſider, if his Proof conſutes this, (viz.) Gal. 3.27. <hi>For as many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt; this is that Righteouſneſs that is imputed to us, and procures the Diſcharge from our Sins or Debts,</hi> by <hi>W. Haworth</hi>'s own Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This being Baptized into Chriſt is explained by the ſame Apoſtle, Rom. 6.3,4,5,6. <hi>Know ye not that ſo many of us as were baptized into Chriſt, were baptized into his Death; therefore we are buryed with him by baptiſm into Death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed from the Dead by the Glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in Newneſs of Life; for if we have been planted together in the Likeneſs of his Death, we ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the Likeneſs of his Reſurrection; knowing this, that our Old Man is crucified with him, that the Body of Sin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve Sin.</hi> And this Phraſe, <hi>We have put on Chriſt,</hi> is alſo expounded by the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.12,13,14. <hi>And let us put on the Armour of Light, ſo that we walk honeſtly, as in the Day time; not in Gluttonny and Drunkenneſs, neither in Chambering and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, nor in Strife and Envy; but put ye on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and take no thought for the Fleſh, to fulfil the Luſt of it.</hi> The Tranſlators on the Margin ſay, <hi>To put on Chriſt is to poſſeſs Chriſt, to have him in us, and us in him.</hi> So that by his own Proof, expounded by Men wiſer then himſelf, in this Point, caſts his Cauſe quite againſt him, and makes him ſay, <hi>That to poſſeſs Chriſt in us, is the Real, Imputed or reckoned Righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> in which the True Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is accepted of God, and not by a Righteouſneſs whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without us, no nearer to us then the Place where Chriſt perſonally lived and dyed, which <hi>W. Haworth</hi> would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; elſe, why doth he ſo bend his Force againſt my words? And if that <hi>be the beſt Robe put upon us</hi> (as he ſpeaks) why doth he ſo violently contend for another to be imputed to us? or if they be both one (as he ſeems to make them) why doth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40871:18"/> he quarrel with me for maintaining that they ought not to be put aſſunder? Neither doth the Scripture call them <hi>Two Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſes,</hi> as <hi>W. H.</hi> doth in the next Page.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>But it ſeems there is another Righteouſneſs, in which we may be ſaved, and which is by the</hi> Quakers <hi>valued at a higher rate; and that Righteouſneſs may be and is brought nearer to you</hi> Quakers, <hi>then this to us</hi> Chriſtians, p. 34, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> It is thy Work to make <hi>two Righteouſneſſes of Chriſt;</hi> We ſay, that whoever hath Chriſt within, in his Heart, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not undervalue the <hi>Righteouſneſs that Chriſt</hi> wrought in his own Perſon without, nor yet miſs of the Acceptance with God through him, nor can ſuch a one be deprived of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and Priviledges thereof. But Thouſands called <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> believe the Hiſtory of what Chriſt did and ſuffered, and the Imputation of that Righteouſnesſ to Sinners, that will periſh for all that Belief; becauſe <hi>Chriſt is not formed in their Hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is ſad to ſee men profeſſing <hi>Goriſtianity,</hi> to be troubled and diſquieted becauſe Chriſt is come ſo near as to dwell in the Hearts of the faithful; its a great ſign that that Man's Heart is not right. But why is <hi>W. Haworth</hi> ſo angry that Chriſt is come ſo near the <hi>Quakers?</hi> Did he not ſay even now, <hi>That Chriſt was put upon us by the Father's Gift, &amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>Who of us ever denyed that we were to have a Real Righteouſneſs in Sanctification? but this is not to juſtifie us,</hi> p. 35, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> Thy words ſavour as if the Righteouſneſs thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteſt to be ſaved and juſtified by, is but hiſtorical or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary on thy part, and is not attended with Reality, Evidence and Certainty that the Righteouſneſs of Sanctification is atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with.</p>
               <p>And if I ſhould infer from thy words, that it is reallity thou ſighteſt againſt, thy words will more certainly juſtifie me, then ever ſuch a Faith (in God's light) will juſtifie thee, by an Imagination of Righteouſneſs without a real Injoyment of it, we ſay God hath joyned what Chriſt did outwardly and what he doth inwardly together, to compleat the Work of Man's Salvation and Redemption. We ſay of Heart-Holineſs

But on the contrary, the pure in Heart do and ſhall (to their Joy) behold him forever. And we ſay with the Apoſtle, viz. <hi>He that doth Righteouſneſs</hi> is the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Man, or is <hi>righteous, as Chriſt is righteous. W. Haworth</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that believes Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to be imputed to him, is juſtified, or righteous, as Chriſt is righteous, by that bare Faith without Works, &amp;c.</hi> The Difference I refer to the Ballance of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> there to be weighed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious Reader.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> This is an Unſcriptural Saying, not according to the wholſome Form of Sound Words, which ought to be kept to: But however, they are one in Nature and Kind.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>We muſt be without or free from all manner of Good, as Chriſt was without or free from all manner of Evil in the Point of Juſtification,</hi> p. 36, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> Who ever before thee affirmed ſuch Doctrine (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Ranters?</hi>) what our Hearts and Minds, Bodies and Souls, muſt be as much without Grace and the Spirit of God, and as free from all manner of Good when we are juſtified, as Chriſt was without or free from all manner of Evil: Then the greater Sinners, the fitter Subjects for Juſtification. And the Apoſtle muſt needs be quite out when he <hi>gives Thanks to God</hi> (Col. 1.12.) <hi>who hath made us meet to be Partakers of the Inheritance, &amp;c.</hi> Was this <hi>Meetneſs</hi> a Freedom from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Good, &amp;c? But let us trace this a little further (viz.) What becomes of the Light of Chriſt in Man, that maketh manifeſt and reproveth in the Conſcience for Sin? is that ſo bad, and free from all manner of Good, that there is not one Good Property belongs to it? Why then (pag. 19.) doſt thou call it <hi>a Spark of that Light</hi> Adam <hi>had in Innocency?</hi> Surely it is not ſo bad then as to be free from all manner of Good, ſeeing God created Man in his own Image, and it was Good. What is that Faith which ſees and layes hold of that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40871:19"/> Righteouſneſs? <hi>Is this as free from all manner of Good as Chriſt was from Evil?</hi> But whence come all thoſe Breathings and Pantings, Hungrings and Thirſtings after Righteouſneſs? were all ſuch Perſons then juſtified? or were thoſe Buddings as free from all manner of Good as Chriſt was from Evil? Hear Dr. <hi>Sibbs,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">The Bud of a Good Deſire, and the Bloſſom of a Good Reſolution, and the Fruit of a Good Action, all comes from God.</q> Then not as free from all manner of Good as Chriſt was from Evil. <q rend="inline margQuotes">Nay, ſaith the Doctor, The Light whereby we know, and the Guidance whereby we chooſe, that is from a higher agent then our ſelves,</q> cap. 15. <hi>Soul's-Conflict,</hi> pag. 220. Then Man is not as free from all manner of Good, when he is juſtified, as Chriſt was from Evil.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>The Gifts and Vertues that God's Spirit works in us are our own Righteouſneſs, in Contra-diſtinction to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs whereby we are juſtified,</hi> p. 36. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> It's well thou art ſo far informed ſince thy laſt Book, that they are not divided, but diſtinguiſhed, and that Chriſt is the Author of both.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>The Gifts and Virtues of the Spirit are really in our Minds, this is the Righteouſneſs that ſanctifies,</hi> p. 36. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> So then by thy Doctrine our own Righteouſneſs ſanctifies, and Chriſt's Righteouſneſs juſtifies: But ſeeing by thy own Confeſſion Chriſt is the Author of both, why doſt thou call the one ours, and the other his? is Chriſt divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>Chriſt had the Guilt of Sin really charged on him,</hi> p. 37. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> This makes good my Charge againſt him, viz that Chriſt was not innocent when he ſuffered &amp;c. contrary to the Scriptures, which teſtifie that the Juſt ſuffered for the Unjuſt: But let us conſider his Phraſe, <hi>The Guilt of Sin really charged on him;</hi> this Word [<hi>Really</hi>] as it reſpects the Act of God, is interpreted by himſelf, p. 33. <hi>What the Lord doth is ſo, or really done;</hi> and as it reſpects Man, p. 35. he ſaith, <hi>Who of us ever denyed that we were to have a Real Righteouſneſs, &amp;c.</hi> Now let the judicious Reader conſider how <hi>W.

               <p>Haworth, <hi>If he had not Sin on him, God in Righteouſneſs could not have puniſhed this innocent Lamb: But thou art aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> (<hi>I tell thee</hi>) <hi>of Chriſt's Croſs,</hi> p. 37. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> As a guilty Man, that hath ſpoke more then he can prove, he ſhuffles out the main Matter of the Charge againſt him, <hi>viz.</hi> the Guilt of Sin really charged on Chriſt; ſo that I may take it for granted he ſees his Blaſphemy in that, though he loves not the Sight ſo well as to confeſs his Error in plain VVords: But why <hi>William</hi> doſt thou (a guilty Man) take upon thee to meaſure the Omnipotency of the Almighty? is not this Pride in thee with a witneſs; but to prove Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally guilty he ſaith, <hi>God in Righteouſneſs puniſhed this IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOCENT LAM<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Haworth, Paul <hi>in</hi> Rom. 7. <hi>complains of Sin, yet ſaith, there is no Condemnation,</hi> Rom. 8.1. &amp;c. p. 78. &amp;c,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> What an Abuſe is this put upon <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words? why did he complain then? if God was pleaſed, why was he diſpleaſed? But the Apoſtle is ſpeaking of ſeveral Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that he paſſed through (as the whole Chapter manifeſteth) not that he was in them all at the ſame Moment of Time (viz.) <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Law, without the Law, and delivered from the Law, a wretched Man</hi> (<hi>becauſe of the Body of Sin</hi>) &amp; ſuch a Saint alſo that no Condemnation belonged to him; therefore himſelf diſtinguiſheth both the Time by the Word [<hi>Now</hi>] there is no Condemnation, &amp;c and Manner or Condition of his Change viz. <hi>To abide in Chriſt, &amp; not to walk after the Fleſh, but after the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40871:20"/> Spirit,</hi> clearly implying, that if he neglect the Spirit, and walk after the Fleſh, there will then be Condemnation.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>As if Chriſt might not work Virtues in our Hearts, which we expreſs in our Lives, and yet theſe be but our own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, &amp;c. as if becauſe the Spirit works Love in me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not my Love, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Crook,</hi> I have mentioned this (under Title Contradiction) I deſire the Reader to obſerve, how within ſix Lines after (quite contrary) he ſaith, <hi>None ever did or can ſhew Chriſt's Virtues, in their Lives, that were not firſt juſtified by imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> and yet here he ſaith, <hi>The Virtues which Chriſt works in our Hearts, and we expreſs in our Lives, are but our own Righteouſneſs:</hi> Obſerve, and yet is wrought by Chriſt, ſo that we may be found in our own Righteouſneſs, and yet at the ſame Time be juſtified by the imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, without Works [Oh Confuſion!] But let's exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his Reaſon for what he ſaith (<hi>viz.</hi>) becauſe the <hi>Spirit works Love in me, therefore its my Love, &amp;c.</hi> by the ſame Reaſon Chriſt's Righteouſneſs may be called my Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by thy own Confeſſion, <hi>p.</hi> 34. ſaying, <hi>Indeed this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is not at a Diſtance from us, but put upon us by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Gift.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou haſt now ſpoiled all, after thou haſt taken a great deal of Pains to prove the Righteouſneſs that Chriſt works in us and the <hi>Righteouſneſs that indeed is not at a Diſtance from us, but put upon us by the Fathers</hi>'s <hi>Gift</hi> (as thou ſayeſt) to be two Righteouſneſſes; and here thou giveſt a very good Reaſon why they cannot be two, but muſt needs be one, <hi>viz.</hi> For the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> works <hi>Love</hi> in me, therefore it is my <hi>Love,</hi> ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> works <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> in me, therefore it is my <hi>Righteouſneſs;</hi> and Chriſt imputes his <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> to me, and indeed it's not at a <hi>Diſtance from me, but put upon me by the Father's Gift</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is my <hi>Righteouſneſs:</hi> And thus thou haſt brought Chriſt's <hi>Two</hi> Righteouſneſſes (as thou calleſt them) into <hi>One,</hi> and proved that I may call it <hi>Mine,</hi> for the ſame Reaſon that I may call the <hi>Love</hi> that the Spirit works in me <hi>My Love.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> I meddle not with your preaching, but with what thou haſt printed, viz. <hi>That we muſt be without, or free from all Good, as Chriſt was without, or free from all Evil, when Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is imputed to us to juſtifie us,</hi> or in point of Juſtification; and for the Gifts and Virtues of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which God himſelf works in our Minds, and we expreſs theſe outwardly in our Obſervation of the Moral Law, in our walking amongſt men; this ſayeſt thou, is <hi>properly our own Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. therefore our own Righteouſneſs, ſaith <hi>W. H.</hi> (who mixeth my words with his) and then asks <hi>how I can in Conſeience go about to make the People believe, &amp;c.</hi> while his own words tend ſo much to <hi>Rantiſm</hi> and Looſneſs.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>I challenge thee and all the</hi> Quakers <hi>in</hi> England <hi>to prove that Chriſt bound the Moral Law to any of his Diſciples cloſer, or faſter then</hi> Moſes, p 43.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> If Looſneſs be not pleaded for, what means this <hi>low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.</hi> But why art thou ſo reſolute in thy Challenge? doth the Buſineſs ſo nearly concern thee, that all the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>England</hi> are ſummoned to appear? &amp;c. I think the leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them may make good that from <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.21,22. where Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>whoſoever is angry with his Brother without a cauſe, ſhall be culpable of Judgment, which he that killeth is guilty of;</hi> and is not this to bind the Law cloſer? Is it not eaſier to abſtain from Murder, then from Anger. And ver. 27, 28. by the Law actual Adultery was forbidden, but Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever looketh upon a Woman to luſt after her, hath committed Adultery with her already in his Heart;</hi> is not this a cloſer binding of the Moral Law to his <hi>Diſciples?</hi> let the Reader judge. And if thou hadſt more Knowledge of thy own Heart, and fewer Notions in thy Head, thou wouldſt not have made ſuch a vaunting Challenge.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>I charge thee with belying Chriſt, in ſaying, that he calls this Principle,</hi> viz. <hi>To do to others, as we would be done by, the ſtrait Gate,</hi> p. 43. &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:40871:21"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> Thy Charges and foul Language are ſo familiar with thee, that thou matters not what thou ſayſt: My words are theſe, <hi>Chriſt commands doing as we would be done by, and calls it the ſtrait Gate, foreſeeing that falſe Prophets would preach another broader way and wider Gate, therefore the next words ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of falſe Prophets, and at preſent thou art one of them;</hi> &amp;c. This it ſeems pinched, and made thee ſo angry, and haſty in thy Charge, that thou <hi>belyeſt</hi> (to pay thee in thy own Coyn) my words, in ſaying, that <hi>Chriſt calls this Principle,</hi> To do, &amp;c. <hi>the Strait Gate,</hi> when my words are, <hi>Chriſt commands doing, &amp;c.</hi> but let's hear thy proof,</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>Thy only Argument that can be brought, is this,</hi> viz. <hi>That this Sentence, Strait is the Gate, doth immediately come after the other,</hi> viz. <hi>To do as we would have others, &amp;c. But now</hi> Luke 13.23. <hi>this paſſage of doing as we would be done by, is omitted,</hi> p. 43. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> I perceive thou likeſt it not, yet for ought thou haſt yet ſaid, that Argument is good, and I ſee no more Cauſe to decline it, becauſe <hi>Luke</hi> omits it, then to reject it, becauſe <hi>Matthew</hi> ſo joyns it, <hi>Mark and John</hi> being both ſilent about it, except thou canſt prove <hi>Luke</hi> the more infallible Pen-man. But this is not my only Argument (remember that is falſe) for I find theſe words, <hi>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you,</hi> &amp;c. relative, as appears by the word [<hi>Therefore</hi>] at the Beginning of the verſe, and ſo are the like in moſt of the verſes before, and for this Cauſe it may be reaſonably judged to be relative alſo, conſidering it is Chriſt's continued Sermon upon the Mount; but beſides all this, the Law and the Prophets, which thou callſt <hi>Morallity,</hi> is the ſum of it, and Chriſt came to fulfil and eſtabliſh it; and thy ſelf confeſſeth, <hi>The Law is preached for conviction, and ſo is called the School maſter by the Apoſtle;</hi> and why not the <hi>Strait Gate by Chriſt.</hi> Again, if the <hi>wide Gate and broad Way that leads to Deſtruction, be Liberty in licentious and wicked courſes?</hi> Why on the contrary, may not <hi>the Strait Gate and narrow Way that leads to Life,</hi> be a cloſe walking in all the Commandments of God; for if to love God, above all, and my Neighbour as my ſelf, be the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40871:21"/> and there are not greater then theſe, as Chriſt ſaid to the good <hi>Scribe?</hi> Why may not this, that is the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy</hi> and Sum of the Law and Prophets, viz. <hi>To do as we would be done by</hi>) be called the <hi>Strait Gate,</hi> as well as Self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial and taking up the daily Croſs, is called the <hi>Narrow Way? Luke</hi>'s omitting it is but thy poor Shuffle; for he hath omitted abundance more in the ſame chapter; and that which he doth mention is different from <hi>Matthew, Matthew</hi> ſaith, <hi>Enter in at the ſtrait Gate; Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>strive to enter, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If by the ſtrait Gate the Perſon of Chriſt had been intended, he ſhould have ſaid, believe in the Perſon of Chriſt, and enter; but by <hi>striving to enter in at the strait Gate,</hi> is to endeavour with all ones Might to keep the Commandments of God, whereof this is one, viz. <hi>To do as we would be done by;</hi> and as Chriſt ſaid in anſwer to a Queſtion (like that <hi>thou</hi> ſayeſt was the occaſion of thoſe Words) in <hi>Luke, Strive to enter,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 19 17. <hi>If thou wilt</hi> [<hi>enter</hi>] <hi>into Life,</hi> &amp;c (The Word [<hi>enter</hi>] anſwers to <hi>Gate</hi>) <hi>keep the Commandments:</hi> And <hi>Mark</hi> 10.21. adds, <hi>Take up the Croſs and follow Chriſt.</hi> All which is further confirmed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.10. <hi>And they that were ready went in with the Bridegroom to the Wedding, and the Gate was ſhut</hi> (i.e.) the Opportunity was now paſt, not that the Perſon of Chriſt is here the Gate; for he is here called the Bridegroom; and Chriſt ſaith to urge the Improve of Opportunities, <hi>I muſt work the Works of him that ſent me, while it is Day; the Night cometh when no man can work,</hi> John 9.4. So that the narrow way of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> and to follow <hi>Chriſt in the Light through the daily Croſs, and to keep the Commandments of God,</hi> whereof this is one, <hi>To do in all things whatſoever, as we would be done unto, for this is the Law and the Prophets</hi> (viz.) The entring in at the ſtrait Gate, according to <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.12.13. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy charging me with belying Chriſt falls upon thy own pate; and alſo thy abuſing the Law and the Prophets, in calling [<hi>that</hi>] which is the Sum of them (fleightingly) <hi>a Principie of Morality.</hi>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40871:23"/> evil Thoughts ariſing in the Heart, according to Chriſt's Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. ſo that if there be not conſent, there is no Tranſgreſſion, and conſequently not Sin; but thou would'ſt have the 10th Commandment (as it were) to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in Nature from all the reſt, and to forbid more, as if to <hi>covet</hi> my Neighbour's Houſe were worſe then to <hi>kill</hi> my Neighbour, and to <hi>covet</hi> my Neighbour's Ox were worſe then to <hi>ſteal</hi> it.</p>
               <p>Arg. 3. Haworth, <hi>That which is to be mortified and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified muſt needs be Evil, &amp;c. I ask from wherce they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, &amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> To deny, reſiſt and refuſe to conſent to <hi>Motions</hi> to Evil, is a mortifying and crucifying of them: And for thy further Information, they ariſe (<hi>a naturae vitio</hi>) (<hi>i. e.</hi>) from a Defection of Nature, and inclines to Sin, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Arg. 4. Haworth, <hi>If they are ſuch as are a Burden to one that is made Partaker of the new Nature, then they muſt be evil and ſinful, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook.</hi> This is as true of Outward Afflictions and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as of Inward Motions and Riſings; and no man will ſay, that theſe are ſinful in themſelves, and yet they are burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to ſuch as are made Partakers of the New Nature, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Arg. 5. Haworth, <hi>If theſe Motions bring ſo much Guilt upon a man that there is need of the Attonement of Chriſt, and if it were not for the Grace of God in Chriſt we ſhould be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for them, &amp;c. then they are Evil; but, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> It is the Grace of God in Chriſt that enables a man to wreſtle with, and deny to conſent unto theſe Motions; and therefore theſe Motions, unconſented to, are not his Sin, and conſequently bring neither Guilt nor Condemnation.</p>
               <p>Arg. 6. Haworth, <hi>That which flows from an Evil Fonntain, muſt needs be Evil; but, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> By thy own Confeſſion in pag. 59. thou ſayeſt,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40871:24"/> That in Caſe we yield not to Satan's Temptations, we are not guilty; ſo that thou haſt anſwered thy ſelf: For, either thoſe Temptations, which come from Satan, come not from an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Fountain, or elſe there is no Neceſſity that, that which flows from an Evil Fountain muſt needs be the Evil of Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Perſons.</p>
               <p>Arg. 7. Haworth, <hi>That which is a Privation of that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Image that was at firſt in man, and ſhould be now in man, and the Law requires it ſhould be in everyone of us, that muſt needs be Evil; but, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> I deny that Evil Riſings or Motions to Evil have made ſuch a Privation of that firſt Image of God in man, that there is not ſo much of it remaining in man as to reſiſt or ſhew a diſlike to them; for the <hi>Heathen Poet</hi> proves the contrary — <hi>Video meliora proboque, tamen deteriora ſequor</hi> (i.e.) I ſee the beſt things, and approve them to be ſo, yet I follow the worſt.</p>
               <p>Arg. 8. Haworth, <hi>Theſe Motions muſt be either Good, Evil or Indifferent; if Good, they ought to be conſented to; Evil the</hi> Quakers <hi>deny them to be, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> By the ſame Argument the Temptations of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil muſt needs be our Sin, though not conſented to (which thy ſelf denyes) for he is either Good, Evil or Indifferent; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t thou wilt not ſay, He is a Good <hi>Devil,</hi> nor yet an Indifferent <hi>One;</hi> therefore he muſt needs be an Evil One, and ſo are his Temptations. I have already acknowledged, That in a ſtrict Senſe, as in themſelves, they are Evil, yet not [my] Evil, ſo as to damn or condemn me, except I conſent to them; no more then <hi>Christ</hi> will ſave me, except he be [my] <hi>Christ,</hi> by being received into my Heart by a Lively Faith, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus I have Anſwered thy <hi>Arguments;</hi> now a few words to ſome Paſſages to the ſame purpoſe in pag. 59.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>I grant, that in caſe we yield not to Satan, we are not guilty,</hi> p. 59.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:40871:24"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> This is to fancy that there is ſomething worſe then the Devil; for, although we conſent not to <hi>Motions</hi> to Evil, yet we are <hi>guilty,</hi> ſayeſt thou; but if we do the like to Satan, we are not guilty, according to thy Judgment.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>May I not ſay, its caſier to reſist the Devil or Tempter then theſe, viz. Motions to Evil, theſe are ſo near, cloſe and continued?</hi> p. 59.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> This doth not only make the Effect of Evil worſe then the Cauſe, but alſo ſuppoſeth, that when <hi>Christ</hi> conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Devil,</hi> he did not overcome the worſt Enemy of God and Mankind. And further, as if the Devil was at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and as unconcerned, when theſe work ſtrongeſt; but if bare Motions to Evil be worſe then the Devil, and the Sin of thoſe that conſent not, but judge and deny them, then its no matter who conſents or who denyes, if he that denyes ſins as well as he that conſents.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing thou art one of thoſe, that regard more who ſpeaks then what is ſaid, I ſhall conclude this in the words of a Doctor of your own, and I could wiſh the Profeſſors of our Dayes were of no worſe Spirit and Temper, (viz.)

               </p>
               <p>Agreeable to this are the Words of Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> cap. 6. <hi>Of Original Sin</hi> (he ſaith) <q rend="inline margQuotes">A vicious Nature, or a natural Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probity, when it is not conſented to, is not a Sin. but an ill Diſpoſition, &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>I have been the larger upon this Subject, becauſe if Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Evil in Unconſenting Perſons be not ſinful, then Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is attainable in this Life: And the contrary Doctrine, that pleads for a neceſſity of Sinning while we are here (in this Life) falls to the ground, with that Opinion which damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Infants that dye in the Womb, or ſoon after they are born, both which may be razed out of ſuch Profeſſors Creed, as ſorraign &amp; unknown to Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and to the true Church ſome Centuries after their deceaſe: For as one ſaith, <hi>God ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Crook,</hi> Theſe are light ſcoffing Words, for which thou muſt come to Judgment, notwithſtanding thou wouldſt father them upon me, but I deny thy Slanders, &amp;c. Thou haſt heard me ſeveral times, with many Profeſſors in <hi>Hartford</hi> beſides Friends; is it probable I ſhould ever ſpeak ſuch Unſavoury Words, and they ſhould eſcape the Preſs 14 or 15 Years, and that <hi>W. H.</hi> and his Followers ſhould after this go to hear ſuch a man as <hi>I. Crook,</hi> that (as thou ſayeſt) ſpeaks ſo ſcornfully of the Scriptures (as to call them Scraps) that it ſhould never be printed till <hi>W. H.</hi> falling out with the <hi>Quakers</hi> undertook it? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member about 14 or 15 Yearsſince, or there abouts, that I ſpake ſomething of <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s Hiſtory touching the Diſperſion &amp; Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together of the Scriptures, &amp; poſſibly I might ſay to the man he ſpeaks of, repeating my Words wrong, and yet juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his own Repetition (to put an End to his Contention) that theſe were not my Words; for it is not my Judgment; and this is to ſay no more then thy ſelf implies by the Word [<hi>If</hi>] <hi>they were my Words,</hi> which argues my queſtioning whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were ſo or no.</p>
               <p>Now what Fault is this that it muſt be proclaimed in print? The worſt that can be made of it (ſuppoſing it true, as it is not) amounts but to this (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Iohn Crook</hi>'s Meaning was better then his Words, then with the <hi>Younger Brother in the Goſpel, Iohn Crook</hi> is to be <hi>juſtified,</hi> rather then thoſe Hypocrites, who like the Elder Brother ſay, <hi>I go Sir,</hi> but went not; and then ſuch now, that exhort their Hearers to follow Chriſt fully, and obey the Scriptures conſtantly, but withal tell them, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to do either in this World.</p>
               <p>Therefore I would adviſe every well-meaning <hi>Abimelech</hi> to take heed that at any time his Meaning be not better then his Words; for if <hi>W. H.</hi> hear of it, as <hi>Doeg</hi> to <hi>Saul,</hi> he will tell it to the World, if poſſible, to do thee a Miſchief, although it be 14 or 15 Years after.</p>

               <p>Haworth, <hi>My Eye hath been deceived ſometimes by the Art of Limbing, in thinking I have ſeen living Creatures, Men, Women, Lyons, Bulls, &amp;c. and yet turn but the other ſide, and nothing but a thin painted Paſtboard, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">p. 54.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou haſt got the Art Captains have at Sea, thou thinkſt it lawful as they do, thou comeſt up to us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with an Engliſh Flag,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou art abſolutely a</hi> French-man, <hi>&amp;c. Thou,</hi> John, <hi>art but ſtill a Thin, Dead, Life-leſs, Rotten Apoſtate</hi> Quaker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> What now a Rotten Apoſtate, and once a Living Stone in Chriſt's Building! am I fallen away from Grace then? By this the Reader may ſee what a painted Chriſtian this man is, that to make good his <hi>Simile</hi> dares to adventure upon ſuch a Falſhood ſo incredible, as that he ſhould know thoſe to be but Pictures upon Paſtboard, and yet his Eye to be ſo deceived, as himſelf thought thoſe Pictures to be living Men and Women, Lyons, Bulls, &amp;c. This puts me in mind of the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s blaming the Painter for colouring the Faces of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſo Red, who tartly replied, <hi>He painted them ſo, as bluſhing at the Lives of thoſe men who ſtiled themſelves their Succeſſors:</hi> But how the Reader will forbear bluſhing, and ſmiling too, at ſuch a Succeſſor, as knows not Living Men and Women from pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Paſtboards, I know not; but no wonder that this man's Tongue is at Liberty to ſpeak Falſhood without Controle ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſaid but two Pages before, <hi>He dares not truſt to the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and ſuch neither fear nor care for its <hi>Condemnation</hi> for any thing they ſay or do.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>I have heard lately from one that hath read</hi> J. C<hi>'s Books, that he expreſſeth, himſelf to be for this</hi> (viz.) <hi>A Liberty for</hi> Quakers <hi>to admit themſelves into all Churches whatſoever, &amp;c. He can ſpeak any thing with his Mouth to the People, and believe the contrary thing in his Judgment at the ſame time; but I begin to be weary of playing thus at puſh-pin with thee and the</hi> Quakers <hi>going three Miles on their Knees, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Crook,</hi> It is well thou wilt afford the <hi>Quakers</hi> this Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, while many of thy Opinion (who talk ſo much that Chriſt [wholely without] hath ſatisfied for all their Sins paſt, preſent and to come) ſleight Morality, and thy Words are of like Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, as if to live up to Morality doth <hi>Neceſſarily</hi> imply, that ſuch as do ſo, do not at all live in the Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt; but let all ſuch know, that he which exhorts People to Holineſs, and yet tells them it is not neceſſary to Salvation, doth but tempt them to let Holineſs alone.</p>

                  <hi>Crook,</hi> I need not here ſet down the <hi>Additional Poſt ſcript</hi> he ſpeaks of, becauſe it is in Print already, but do deſire the Reader to peruſe it, and for his Encouragement I do ſeriouſly declare, as in the Preſence of God, Angels and Men, that the Teſtimony there given (1<hi>ſt</hi>) Concerning Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth, &amp;c.</hi> (2<hi>dly</hi>) Concerning his Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (3<hi>dly</hi>) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Blood of this Jeſus, &amp;c.

               </head>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>DOſt not thou know that the</hi> Independents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Query 1. <hi>are for an Experimental Spiritual Knowledge of Chriſt, and that Truth muſt be inwardly taught by the Spirit, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Crook, Theſe are</hi> Jacob's <hi>Words,</hi> but <hi>Eſau</hi>'s Hands; for he that dare not truſt to the Spirit, is not for Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Knowledge, &amp;c. but <hi>W. H.</hi> ſaith, p. 52. <hi>He dares not truſt to the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> therefore W. H. (wharever he ſaith) is not for <hi>Experimental</hi> Knowledge, by the Teachings of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Q. 2. Haworth, <hi>Doſt not thou believe that ſome may know the Myſtery and ſo be ſaved, without the hearing or knowing the Hiſtory of Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An. Crook,</hi> Infants that dye in the Womb and ſoon after they are born, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have ſo much Charity as to believe they are ſaved, and likewiſe thoſe believing <hi>Gentiles, Rom.</hi> 2.14,15,16. of whom it is ſaid, they had not the Law, or outward Hiſtory, and yet were excuſable <hi>in the Day</hi> when God ſhall judge the Secrets of all men by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Q. 3. Haworth, <hi>Whether is Jeſus Chriſt now a Perſon out of man, or only a Principle, or Quality in man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An. Crook,</hi> If by [<hi>Paerſon</hi>] thou intendeſt [<hi>An Intelligent Being</hi>] as thou confeſſedſt at <hi>Hartford</hi>) then <hi>He is</hi> both out of man, and in man, and ſo more then a bare Principle or Quality in man.</p>
               <p>Q. 4. Haworth, <hi>Doſt thou believe, that man that was born of</hi> Mary <hi>the Virgin at</hi> Bethlehem <hi>in</hi> Judea, <hi>to be the</hi> Meſſiah, <hi>the Chriſt of God?</hi>

                  <hi>An. Crook,</hi> Yea.</p>
               <p>Q. 5 Haworth, <hi>Doſt thou believe that the man Chriſt is any where now in being, beſides the being that the</hi> Quakers <hi>ſay he hoth in them, and if ſo, where is he? &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>An. Crook,</hi> Yea, and that he is at God's Right Hand, aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded far above all Heavens, as the Scripture ſaith.</p>
               <p>Q. 6. Haworth, <hi>Whether the Light that you ſay every man hath be a Creature or no?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An. Crook.</hi> That true Light which is called the Life of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.4,9. and lighteth every man that cometh into the World, is not a Creature.</p>
               <p>Q. 7. Haworth, <hi>Whether the Light that every man hath be of the very ſame Nature with the Spirit &amp;c. or of a different Kind, or whether it differ from the New-creature in Specie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An. Crook,</hi> The Life which is the Light of men is of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created and Divine Nature and Being, yet the New-creature is formed in the Light, and partakes of its Nature.</p>
               <p>Q. 8. Haworth, <hi>Whether that which Ieſus Chriſt of</hi> Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <hi>did and ſuffered above ſixteen hundred Years ſince in</hi> Judea <hi>be not the Matter of fallen-man's Iuſtification in the Sight of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An. Crook,</hi> Fallen-man is in a State of Condemnation, yet through that one Offering of Jeſus Chriſt of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> both the Forbearance of God, Reconciliation, and Remiſſion of Sins are declared unto Mankind, and received through Faith and Repentance.</p>
               <p>Q. 9. Haworth, <hi>Whether any Actions or Sufferings of any beſides thoſe of his, have any Merit, Worth, Deſert in them to purchaſe any thing at God's hand for any of Mankind?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An. Crook,</hi> 1<hi>ſt,</hi> No man's Actions or Sufferings without Chriſt are of any Merit, or Worth in God's Sight. (2<hi>dly</hi>) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe that Chriſt did and ſuffered above 1600 Years ſince in <hi>Iudea,</hi> his continued Mediation and Interceſſion have Worth and Deſert in them to obtain Good at God's Hand for man. (3<hi>dly</hi>) Beſides a being then reconciled by the Death of his Son, there is a [MUCH MORE] put upon <hi>A being ſaved by his Life,</hi> Rom. 5.10. (4<hi>thly</hi>) The Saints ſincere <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Perſeverance in Chriſt</hi> have Reward from God for his Sake.</p>
               <p>Q. 10. Haworth, <hi>Whether Chriſt Ieſus dyed in the Room, Place, Stead of any, or only for their Benefit or Advantage?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An. Crook,</hi> A ſilly Query; for Chriſt dying for all men in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40871:33"/> their Room or Stead, muſt needs be for their Benefit and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>Q. 11. Haworth, <hi>Whether God's imputing Righteouſneſs to any man be any thing elſe, but his putting Righteouſneſs into the Creature by Saictifying of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An. Crook,</hi> Yea, it is an Accepting of him in Chriſt the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, through Faith and Sanctification in him, whom God hath ſent and given unto us, with whom the Benefit of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Death is ſo reckoned unto us as ours.</p>
               <p>Q. 12. Haworth, <hi>Whether Iustification be not an Act of God in abſolving and acquitting a Sinner for Christ Sake, in Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to condemning, &amp;c. and accounting him Righteous, for the Perſonal, Righteouſaeſs Sake of Christ that was wholely without the Sinner?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An. Crook,</hi> To the firſt Part yea, (<hi>Which proves Immediate Revelation</hi>) through Faith and Repentance, &amp;c. To the laſt, nay, while it is wholely without the Sinner it is none of his; for if Juſtification be God's Act in abſolving a man in Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Condemnation and all God's Actions are Real (as thou ſayeſt in thy Book) then it is not wholely without him; for thoſe to whom there is no Condemnation are ſuch as walk not after the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> but after the <hi>spirit, Rom.</hi> 8.1.</p>
               <p>Q. 13. Haworth, <hi>Whether God doth not find every one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and in their Sins, when he firſt gives Faith to them that juſtifies them, &amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Crook.</hi> Yes, they are both ungodly and in their Sins, while in unbelief; but God doth not juſtifie the ungodly therein, but through Faith, which purifies the Heart, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, &amp;c. But this is a moſt impertinent and ſilly Query; for thoſe muſt needs be found ungodly, who are found without Faith.</p>
               <p>Q. 14. Haworth, <hi>Whether by the Blood of Chriſt thou mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt any thing that is not in thy Heart and Soul, within thy ſelf, whether thou meaneſt that material Blood that was ſhed from that material Body of Ieſus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>when he did hang upon the Tree at Mount</hi> Calvary, <hi>without the Gates at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>with all his material real Sufferings both of Soul and Body?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Crook,</hi> I mean, both the real and material Blood
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40871:33"/> (as thou calleſt it) of Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and the Virtue, Life and Myſtery of it received into my Heart by Faith, with all his real Sufferings both of Soul and Body.</p>
               <p>Q. 15. Haworth, <hi>Whether that Blood there ſhed was not the Blood of God, according to</hi> Acts 20.28. <hi>he being God as well as Man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Crook,</hi> The Blood there ſhed was properly and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitively the Blood of Chriſt, mentioned before, [<hi>that</hi>] by which God did <hi>purchaſe</hi> his Church, according to <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. quoted, was properly <hi>Chriſt himſelf,</hi> he gave <hi>himſelf for us</hi> a Ranſom, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. which takes in his Blood, and all that's moſt Excellent in him both as God and Man.</p>
               <p>Q. 16. Haworth, <hi>Whether Remiſſion of all Sins was not actually purchaſed by the Death of Chriſt above ſixteen hundred years ſince for all that have been or ſhall be ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Crook,</hi> This in Subſtance is but the eighth Query over again, and therefore is anſwered before.</p>
               <p>Q. 17. Haworth, <hi>Is any man any farther juſtified then ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, any farther forgiven, then according to that degree that Sin is mortified in him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Crook,</hi> 1ſt, If by [<hi>farther</hi>] thou meaneſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man may be experimentally (for ſo thou callſt it in thy firſt Query) both acquitted and condemned at the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time, and for the ſame Fact; I ſay, nay. 2dly, If thou askeſt, whether a Defect or Failure in Sanctification cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth an Ecclipſe of Juſtification; I ſay, Yea. 3dly, If by [<hi>farther</hi>] thou intendeſt, whether a man that was once ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, wholely loſeth the Benefit of his former Juſtification by every Failure in Sanctification; I anſwer, Nay; becauſe while the Senſe of God's former Mercy abides in the Heart, Man is ſooner humbled, and his Faith thereby greatly ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for his ſpeedy Recovery. 4thly, Or if by this Query thou wouldſt know, whether a man that is not ſo fully and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly mortified and ſanctified, as he yet deſires and endeavours to be, may notwithſtanding be juſtified by Faith, and have
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40871:34"/> Peace with God through Jeſus Chriſt; I ſay, Yea. 5thly and laſtly, If by [<hi>farther</hi>] thou believeſt (according to pag. 36. of thy Book) that a man <hi>without or as free from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Good, as Chriſt was without or free from all manner of Evil;</hi> may yet in that ſtate be <hi>juſtified,</hi> that is indeed <hi>farther</hi> then I dare go.</p>
               <p>Q. 18. Haworth, <hi>Whether is Juſtification any thing elſe but an Act of the Light within every man, upon Obedience to it, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Peace?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Crook,</hi> Yea, it is more then an Act of the Light, <hi>as in every man;</hi> for its the Act of God, and is called the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Life.</p>
               <p>Q. 19. Haworth, <hi>Whether is there any Good Work done by any man before he is juſtified, and forgiven all his Sins?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Crook,</hi> If man be not juſtified without Faith, nor his Sins forgiven him without Repentance, and if believing and repenting be good Works, the Queriſt anſwers himſelf. Yet I do ſay, both Faith and Repentance do flow as Streams from a Fountain, which Fountain is Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Q 20. Haworth, <hi>Whether Faith as a Habit in, or Act of our Mind, or any Good Work proceeding from the Spirit in us, be any part of that Righteouſneſs that juſtifies?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Crook,</hi> If by proceeding from the Spirit in us, thou intendeſt the Spirit of Chriſt, then Chriſt and his Spirit, being one, what he doth, in Experimental Juſtification (as thou ſpeakeſt) that his Spirit doth alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11.</p>
               <p>Q 21. Haworth, <hi>Whether there is any ſuch thing in the Nature of God as Vindictive Juſtice, ſo that Sin muſt be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed upon all them that accept not of the Attonement of Chriſt Jeſus by the Sacrifice of himſelf?</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Q. 22. Haworth, <hi>Whether the Light within, or the Perſon
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40871:34"/> of Chriſt without, be the Object of Juſtifying Faith; or whether Faith be any thing but Obedience to the Light, that every one hath?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Crook,</hi> This <hi>Query</hi> is contrary to Scripture, which ſaith, <hi>A Natural Body is ſown, a Spiritual Body is raiſed; there is a Natural Body, there is a Spiritual Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.44. which I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. 29. Haworth, <hi>Whether are our diſtinct Perſonal Beings preſerved in the Future State, whether we loſe them, being ſwollowed up into God at Death?</hi>

               <p>Q. 30.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Crook,</hi> My Anſwer plainly to the firſt part of this
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40871:35"/> 
                  <hi>Query</hi> is, That although the Jeſus, the Righteouſneſs, the Juſtification, the Blood, <hi>that I bear Teſtimony unto,</hi> cannot be known but by and in the true Light; yet I never ſaid, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I believe, that the Light, <hi>that every man hath belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in, &amp;c.</hi> [<hi>is</hi>] <hi>the Jeſus, the Righteouſneſs, the Juſtification, the Blood, the Remiſſion, &amp;c.</hi> yet do affirm, <hi>that God, who is Light, is All in All;</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is the <hi>Light, is made of God unto true Believers Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Redemption,</hi> according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. To the ſecond part, I ſay, There is more in my <hi>Treatiſe</hi> and <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript</hi> then <hi>to the Light, obey the Light, &amp;c.</hi> but do alſo teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that whoſoever doth not obey the Light that ſhines in the Heart, and manifeſteth Sin and Evil in the Conſcience, is yet in his Sins, and feeding among the Swine. Now I appeal from <hi>W.H</hi>'s Raſhneſs and Folly, not only to thoſe that have known my manner of Life for nigh Forty Years paſt, how that from my tender years I have been ſeeking after God and his Truth; but to that great <hi>Judge of Quick and Dead,</hi> that will paſs Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon every man according to his Works, unto whom none dare ſay at that Tribunal, God made him to ſin, or made [IT] unavoidable.</p>
               <p>I hope, what I have ſaid will ſatisfie the Honeſt hearted, who will not eaſily believe that after them any weary Steps and toylſome years of hearing, reading, watching, faſting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, praying, &amp;c. I ſhould ſacrifice all this and much more unto a wilful Error, and to <hi>ſuch an one</hi> as is not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of all worldly Preferments, but expoſed to all the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Hardſhips in it; which I muſt needs do, if I am ſuch a Perſon as <hi>W. H.</hi> repreſents me to be. But were I guilty, ſuch confuſed Arguments, Contradictions and hard Languages will never convince me that <hi>W.H.</hi> is in the Truth; for he is but a weak Adverſary that cannot diſtinguiſh between loud Clamours and Goſpel Demonſtrations.</p>

That full Flame <hi>Adam</hi> had in Innocency, of which there is a Spark in every man, that Voice of God that ſpoke to <hi>Adam,</hi> that reproves for Sin, and keeps from going on in Sin, the Gift of Chriſt by which ſome divine things may be known, which worketh a change in the Life and Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.

               <p>Thy high Charge of Blaſphemy is like to fall upon thy ſelf; for, to ſay Chriſt is not at all in his People, is contrary to the whole current of Scripture, and is contradictory to thy ſelf in many Pages of thy Book, &amp;c. as may be ſeen in my <hi>Rejoynder.</hi>

               <p>I have read that Chriſt compared the Unfruitful Hearers to the ſeveral Grounds, but I never heard of any Stony, Thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, High-way-Ground Law of God or Scriptures before.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>I know the Spiritualluy of the Law convincing me of Evil Thoaghts, &amp;c.</hi> p. 14. <hi>The Spirit that convinceth the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving World is neither Law nor Goſpel.

               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> What Confuſion is here? Sometimes the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth of ſecret Thoughts, and ſometimes again the Spirit makes uſe of the Doctrine of the Law to convince of Sin, and ſometimes it is neither Law nor Goſpel that doth it; ſometimes abſolutely denying that wicked men have the Spirit, and here he confeſſeth it is the Spirit that convinceth the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving World, by the Doctrine of the Law,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſo that it a properly the Work of the Spirit, as when one man cuts or wounds another with a Knife,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we ſay, he man hath cut him, not the Knife or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, &amp;c.</hi> But ſometimes it is the Doctrine of the Goſpel doth all, &amp; by &amp; by the Spirit doth but make uſe of the Doctrine of the Goſpel; ſometimes he intimates, as if the Law &amp; Goſpel in a mild gentle Senſe might be taken one for the other, elſe what means thoſe Words, viz. <hi>It's the Doctrine of the Goſpel, not Law</hi> [<hi>taken ſtrictly</hi>] <hi>that declares Non-imputation of Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes,</hi> &amp; yet p. 14. <hi>The Law requires all the Thoughts of the Heart to be continually spiritual and Holy, and diſcovers or convinceth not of Groſs Sins only, but of Heart-Polutions, &amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. the Diſcovery of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart is aſcribed to the Goſpel, and <hi>W.

               <p>Haworth, <hi>This cannot be; for the Law in its own Nature is

                  <hi>Crook,</hi> My Words to which theſe are an Anſwer are theſe, viz. <hi>The spirituallity of the Law, in the Apoſtle's Senſe, is the Inward Convictions of the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <hi>Crook,</hi> Now he hath reſolved, viz.

Is not this thy unhappy Attempt to be ſo unſuccesful in all thy Deſigns?</p>
               <p>Haworth, Paul <hi>calls them,</hi> viz. <hi>The Gifts and Virtues Chriſt and the Spirit works in our Minds his own Rigteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Phil. 3.5. <hi>Not having my own Righteouſneſs which is of the Law,</hi> p. 47. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> Is there no Difference between the Gifts and Virtues which Chriſt and the Spirit works in our Minds, and the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the <hi>Law</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> there ſpeaks of, let the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er judge what a Preacher thou art: But let us hear <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> viz. lib. <hi>de Gratia &amp; libere arbitrio, Quid eſt non habens me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am juſtitiam quae ex lege eſt, cum ſua non eſſet lex ipſa, ſed Dei, niſi ſuam dicit juſt itiam, quamvis ex lege eſſet, quia ſua voluntate legem ſe poſſe putabat implere ſine adjutorio gratiae, quae eſt per fidem Chriſti.</hi> (i.e.) What is it (ſaith he not having my Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which is of the Law, whereas the Law was not his, but God's, but that he calls it his Righteouſneſs, although it was of the Law, becauſe he thought that by his own will he could fulfil the Law without the Help of Grace, which is by the Faith of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>Only they prepare the Soul for Bleſſedneſs</hi> (viz.) <hi>Purity of Heart, Poverty of Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> p 47.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> Before he ſaid, <hi>We muſt be as much without, or as free from all Good, when Chriſt imputes his Righteouſneſs to juſtifie us, as Chriſt was without or free from all Evil,</hi> and now there muſt be <hi>Poverty of Spirit, and Purity of Heart,</hi> &amp;c to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Soul <hi>for Bleſſedneſs.</hi> Oh Unhappy Man! and Unſtable.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>Let me add this as an Antidote ſtill, that the reality of our inherent Righteouſneſs will not make it perfect,</hi> p. 48 &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> This he calls an <hi>Antidote</hi> (as if he had given ſome Poyſon before) and yet he confeſſeth over and over, That its wrought by God himſelf, by Chriſt, and by the Spirit, and is Reality in the abſtract; yet now it is not perfect, and all the Fault is, becauſe it is ſo <hi>near</hi> us, if it were but far enough off, he would like it better (as I ſuppoſe) but I never (that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) read of any before that called the <hi>real</hi> Work of God himſelf, of Chriſt, and of the Spirit imperfect: Is this thy <hi>Antidote?</hi> I dare ſay, the true-experienced <hi>Chriſtian</hi> will never drink it down, though thou ſayeſt, we may be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by it.</p>
               <p>Haworth, <hi>We ought not to truſt to our Repentings, Believings, &amp;c. for they are imperfect,</hi> p. 49. &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Crook,</hi> Is there no more difference between truſting [<hi>to</hi>] our Repentings, and truſting [<hi>in</hi>] our Repentings? if I do not truſt to it in ſome ſenſe, how can I be aſſured its right? If he that hath true Faith muſt not truſt to it (<hi>viz.</hi>) that it is true, then he muſt be diſtruſtful of it, and ſo continue in Un belief: What Confuſion is this?

               <p>Haworth, <hi>The Phraſe in</hi> Iſa. 64.6. <hi>which thou in Scorn often repeateſt, are the Prophet's Words, &amp;c. he doth ſpeak it of his own Righteouſneſs,</hi> p. 49. &amp;c.</p>

               <p>His own words are theſe (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
               <p>Pag. 1. <hi>I went ſeveral times, as other Boyes did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pag. 4. <hi>Now, there were ſome things the</hi> Quakers <hi>did, that I was not convinced of, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pag. 7. <hi>Though I could not agree with them in all things, &amp;c. and did not like Silent Meetings, nor the Keeping on the Hat, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in pag. 10. <hi>I prayed earneſtly, and in ſeveral Wayes, as in Prayer learnt by the Letter</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>the Lord's Prayer,</hi> Mat. 6. <hi>and I prayed in or by the Spirit, as I thought, and to Chriſt in me, and to Chriſt in the heavens, &amp;c.</hi> (and yet <hi>thought he was perfect,</hi> ſaith W.

               <p>Now, let all people judge if this be the <hi>Quakers</hi> Way and Manner, Faith, Spirit and Principle, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moſt of them be in ſuch Confuſion as this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his ſaying <hi>You</hi> to a ſingle perſon, and calling men <hi>Maſter,</hi> as was his way: And ſee now, W.

               <p>Though thou believeſt in pag. 75. <hi>He was as real a</hi> Quaker <hi>as was in</hi> England; I know no Body elſe will

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40871:47"/> words [<hi>There was Silence in Heaven about the ſpace of half an hour</hi>] and makeſt merry with it to wrong and reproach thy houeſt Neighbours, as one in ſport, pag. 78, 79. but the Lord God will recompence thee according to thy Work.</p>
               <p>And then thou challengeſt me to mention one Lye that thou haſt either ſaid or writ of the Young Man.</p>
               <p>But <hi>William,</hi> may not the Reader wonder at thy Bluſtering, Blind Confidence? let him but look back &amp; weigh what is before written here, and view your little Book well, and there is Proof upon Proof for charging thee, not only with one Lye, but more.</p>
               <p>If thou ſayeſt the man is perfect, as any in our Way, and the ſame man, and many that know it otherwiſe, ſay, he is not, who ſhall be Judge? <hi>W. H.</hi> thy after Chapter-Cover will never hide thy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs; for thy Shame ſhall yet more appear: He never went <hi>farther</hi> then <hi>moſt</hi> of them as <hi>thou haſt ſaid,</hi> thou canſt <hi>never</hi> get <hi>over that;</hi> and beſides, thou knoweſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> at <hi>Hartford</hi> teſtifie, they never knew him to be called a <hi>Quaker,</hi> nor had he any Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip or Society among that People; it is ſtrange he ſhould be ſuch a perfect <hi>Quaker,</hi> and yet ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly a Stranger to them in the ſame Town.</p>
               <p>So all thy <hi>Puſh-Pin Play</hi> with <hi>J.C.</hi> (as thou callſt thy Work, p. 54.) or any Body elſe will never be able to pin thy ſhattered Work together, though thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoureſt to keep up thy Refuge of Lyes with adding and multiplying Lye to Lye, and Slander to Slander, as the Reader may ſee through thy work.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:40871:48"/>
               <p>And in page 81. of thy Book (after many Lyes, Perverſions and groſs Abuſes of our Faith and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple) thou ſayeſt, <hi>What we have done herein, we have done in Truth, and for this End, to obviate the groſs and damnable Errors of the</hi> Quakers — <hi>And that for nine Pages together</hi> (of my Book) <hi>is as ſtrange a Wild-Gooſe-Chaſe as thou haſt ſeen, and the ſame Colworts boyled over again that turns the Reader's Stomach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly <hi>William,</hi> thou doſt but turn the inſide of thine own Stomach outward againſt the Lord's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, foaming out the Enmity and Scorning that lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in thy Heart, to thy own Shame, againſt them, whoſe Cauſe the Lord will plead with thee, and all that thus deride and abuſe them. Art thou a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury man, fit to be a Teacher of others in the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty matters of Eternity, who calls thy own Work <hi>Puſh-Pin?</hi> but thou hadſt better been at that Child's Play, then to have been blaſpheming God, and his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in Heaven.</p>
               <p>And how thou vaunts in page 82. to prove the Light within to be a Natural Light, &amp;c. VV.H. thou canſt not (nor any man upon Earth) prove it to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other then of a Divine Nature, do what ye can, foraſmuch as it manifeſteth Sin, and convinceth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth and condemneth man for Sin; and is of the true Light <hi>that lighteth every man coming into the world</hi> John 1.9. which the Evil-doers hate. <hi>John</hi> 3.20. as thou doſt, ſcoffing and vilifying of it; but it will prove a Stone too heavy for thee at laſt, then ſhalt thou remember me. Thy ſeeming to honour Chriſt's Perſon with thy Lips will not excuſe thee for thy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing his pure Light in the Conſciences of People,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40871:48"/> when he comes to reckon with thee (which time is at hand) then it will be known who divides Chriſt, you or the <hi>Quakers;</hi> for we deny no part of him, but are well aſſured, he is altogether lovely, though en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious blind men have belied us long about theſe things, whoſe Innocency the Lord will clear in his due time, and then your Mouthes will be ſtopt, which now cry, <hi>Groſs and Damnable Errors of the</hi> Quakers, <hi>and that they deny the Reſurrection,</hi> as thou in thy 3d page ſayeſt; and in thy 4th page, <hi>that we deſpiſe the Scripture,</hi> which are all falſe Accuſations and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And page 10. thou ſayeſt, J. C. <hi>is got a Degree above the Apoſtles,</hi> and page 13. <hi>that</hi> J. C. <hi>ſaid, the Apoſtle was out in his Chronology, — and that the Spirit and Letter are one;</hi> and in thy 19th page ſayeſt, <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>believe there is no Manhood of Chriſt now,</hi> which are all Slanders and falſe Accuſations; for we own all according to the Scriptures of Truth, the Lord is our Witneſs, and dare not divide him, as I have ſaid; and in page 25. ſayeſt, <hi>They never do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Sin;</hi> and in page 29. ſayeſt, <hi>J. C. ſtumbles at the Croſs, &amp; counts the Blood of Chriſt no more worth then any other common Blood;</hi> and then among other Lyes and reproachful Terms ſayeſt, <hi>He hath diſcovered himſelf to be a</hi> Papiſt; what a Contradiction is here? do not the <hi>Papiſts</hi> confeſs Sins, W. H? what People more? but it is thy Envy that blinds thee, and will more and more as thou goeſt on in it. And in page 48. ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, <hi>J.C. concludes that Righteouſneſs of Chriſt but a Fancy;</hi> and in page 51. <hi>That thou haſt ſeen ſome Title pages of their Books filled with ſuch Blaſphemies</hi> (viz.) <hi>given forth by the Spirit through the Trunk of the Body of</hi> Fox, <hi>or
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40871:49"/> ſuch a one, and that they account their Writings beyond the Writings of the Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are all thy made Lies, which the Lord will judge thee for; and for ſuch a Title, <hi>Through the Trunk,</hi> &amp;c. I never heard of, nor I believe no Body elſe; but thy Envy is ſo great, it is hard for thee to leave thy Lying and Slandering: And as for the Scriptures of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, we own and eſteem above all other Writings in the World.</p>
               <p>And in page 54. how doſt thou revile and belye <hi>J. Crook</hi> (as in the page before) to render him and the <hi>Quakers</hi> odious? and ſayeſt, <hi>Thou beginneſt to be weary of playing at Puſh-Pin with him,</hi> who never plaid ſo with thee, but wrote to thee in tender Love to thy Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Soul, which is of more concern then Puſh-pin-Play, as thy Scorner's Eye ſhall one Day ſee; but I leave him to anſwer for himſelf, only touch a little on theſe things to manifeſt thy VVickedneſs, that thou mightſt be weary of that, which will be thy Load in the End.</p>
               <p>And in page 55. ſayeſt, <hi>How many turn</hi> Quakers, <hi>whoſe hearts are not turned to God! a Change in their Carriage and Garb, but not in their Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How knowſt thou, <hi>W. H.</hi> what Change is wrought in their Souls? and how dareſt thou ſay, their hearts are not turned to God? VVere not they who were turned from Darkneſs to Light, turned to God, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. Beware of Blaſphemy among thy plentiful Lying and Slandering, thy Unrighteous Judgement ſhall turn upon thy own head.</p>
               <p>And in page 56. tells <hi>of ſome going three Miles on their Knees.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:40871:49"/>
               <p>Surely <hi>William,</hi> thou wilt tell ſuch Lyes ere long, that few, but ſuch as thy ſelf, given up, will believe thee; I never heard of ſuch a thing, but this ſounds like that, <hi>through the Trunk,</hi> &amp;c. hadſt thou ſaid, upon their Feet, we might have believed thee; but thou canſt not ſtoop ſo low, as to ſpeak Truth of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> of whom thou ſayeſt, <hi>They have got the</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh <hi>Knack, to tell their People, that Concupiſcence is no Sin</hi> [which is falſe] <hi>Evil Motions not conſented to is no Sin,</hi> whenas thou thy ſelf grants page 59. <hi>that in Caſe we yield not to Satan, we are not guilty; his Temptations not conſented to, are our Afflictions, not our Sins.</hi> Theſe are thy very VVords, and yet in the ſame page cryeſt out again, <hi>VVe ſay, you plead for Sin, in ſaying the Evil Motions in the heart not conſented to, are not Sin, we ſee by this now your Perfection boaſted of, is no other then that which every Babe in Chriſt hath,</hi> (viz.) <hi>not to conſent to thoſe Evil Motions, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let the Reader ſee this blind man's Confuſion, and what People he is moſt groſly abuſing, reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and ſlandering, who confeſſeth, our Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the ſame which every Babe in Chriſt hath; what will Chriſt ſay to ſuch a one? who ſaid, <hi>It were better a Mill. Stone were hanged about his Neck, and he drowned in the Depth of the Sea, then to offend one ſuch little one, that believes in him:</hi> Shouldſt not thou be more tender toward us, as unto Babes in Chriſt now, who are the ſame in Growth with every ſuch Babe, as thou haſt granted?</p>
               <p>But let us ſee what pity thou haſt to theſe Babes, and let the true Mother judge, as in p. 60. where thou ſayeſt again, viz. <hi>No wonder you your ſelves and your
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40871:50"/> Followers prize not Chriſt's Sufferings and Attonement, but are proud and Phariſaical. — Chriſt's Blood is deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by you;</hi> and after ſeveral more falſe Accuſations cryeſt, <hi>O poor deceived People!</hi> And ſo goes on in his old rode of Railing, Lying and Slandering, as the Reader of his Book might ſee.</p>
               <p>What! our Perfection the ſame which every Babe in Chriſt hath, and yet proud, Phariſaical, deſpiſing Chriſt's Blood, not prizing his Sufferings, and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, and a deceived People; how can this be, <hi>W. H?</hi> ſurely thou haſt greatly belied and abuſed the Babes in Chriſt, as thou wilt remember one Day; for we do highly prize the Blood, Sufferings and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement of Chriſt Jeſus, beyond expreſſion, though ſuch as thou ſpeak all manner of Evil againſt us falſly as God is our Witneſs, who ſhall ſurely judge and condemn thee for thy ſlanderous Tongue, who calls the Light of his dear Son, <hi>A Robber's Light, that goes down to Hell with him,</hi> as in page 63. and page 64. cryeſt, <hi>What a ſore heavy hand is againſt them?</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring us to <hi>Sorcerers and VVitches;</hi> and in page 65. <hi>To a Spirit of Hell and Satan,</hi> and ſo runſt on till thou comeſt to thy Parallel of the <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in which thou ſayeſt, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>own, Works done in the Light are of value,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that they are againſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an Oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O <hi>W. H!</hi> are the Works done in the Light of no value with thee? ſo it ſeems by thy Unfruitful Works of Darkneſs, and undervaluing the true Light, and reproaching the Babes in Chriſt, who value all VVorks done in the Light, as the Children of Light have done in all Ages; and is that a crime
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40871:50"/> for Chriſt's Babes to obey his Commands, who ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> art thou one of them that break his Commands, and teach men ſo? then read thy Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.19. who ſayeſt, page 19. <hi>The Perſon of Chriſt was the</hi> Alpha <hi>and</hi> Omega; and page 85. <hi>That the Perſon of Chriſt is the Tree of Life;</hi> and page 137. <hi>And his Perſon is the Rock of Eternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is this then thy real Deſcription of the Perſon of Chriſt, thou ſo much talkeſt of? Surely as the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the Tree of Liſe, the Rock of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, he was before his coming in the Fleſh, or the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> was born, of whom Chriſt (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Fleſh) came; what is then become of the Glorious Manhood, and Body of Chriſt? Is not that his Perſon? Or doſt thou believe Jeſus Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of two Perſons, one from Eternity, and another in Time? If thou doſt, ſpeak it out.</p>
               <p>In page 84. thou calleſt the Scripture-Language, <hi>A Stone out of the Rubbiſh of this</hi> Babel, where I vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the true Light, that lighteth every man that cometh into the World, in Oppoſition to thy dark Imaginations, who art not worth anſwering; but I mention a little of thy work (which thou calleſt <hi>puſh pin</hi>) that People may ſee how thou puſheſt againſt the Babes in Chriſt, as thou haſt confeſſed, our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is no other, &amp;c. I believe the young man dare not ſpeak altogether ſo badly, as thou haſt done, of that ſame Light which reproved him about going to ſteal the Herring, ſee that remarkable paſſage of his in page 27. of my Anſwer in the Book entituled <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion Rebuked,</hi> which ſtands true againſt you both to this Day.</p>

               <p>And in page 86, and 87. how doſt thou mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt thy Ignorance and Perverſion of the Scriptures! as if it were another thing then the Spirit of Truth (the Saints Comforter) that convinceth the World of Sin, <hi>John</hi> 16.7,8.</p>
               <p>Thou doſt contradict the plain Scripture, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I do not intend to beſtow much Labour about thee, thou art ſo bad and frothy a man, as I have not met with the like of late Years; but I ſhall obſerve one of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Proverbs, not to anſwer thee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy Folly, leſt thou ſhouldſt be more wiſer in thy own Conceit (if poſſible thou canſt) for ſhould we multiply Words, as thou haſt to our Anſwer to thine, it would amount to near 100 Sheets of Paper; though that Scripture, <hi>Job</hi> 11.2,3. thou mentions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, p. 73. I cannot but take a little Notice of, and return it back to thee again, viz. <hi>Should thy Lyes make men hold their Peace, &amp;c.</hi> O no, <hi>W.

               <p>Again, in page 87. thou ſayeſt, <hi>The Light of the Sun and the Wind is of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But O vain man! doth that convince the World of Sin, as the Spirit of Truth doth, of which I was ſpeaking? See more of thy frothy windy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons; art thou a man fit to be anſwered, but with ſharp Rebuke? let the Sober Reader judge; or art thou fit to preach the Goſpel to People, who thy ſelf
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40871:51"/> confeſſedſt to my Face, thou <hi>didſt not know God to be Light?</hi> The Apoſtles of Chriſt knew God to be Light, and preached him ſo, and their Fellowſhip with him, &amp; one with another was in the Light, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. and yet thou confeſſeſt that Chriſt is the Author of all Lights, &amp; that <hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>Light will manifeſt ſome Sin,</hi> p. 88. <hi>but not ſhew the Duſt and Atoms of Sin and Luſt in our Souls,</hi> p. 89. But <hi>William,</hi> I think thy Duſt and Dirt too hath pretty well appeared to the view of <hi>Quakers</hi> and others, who ſee what thou art filled withal againſt the Babes in Chriſt, whom thou ſcoffs at and ſayeſt, <hi>Ye be jealous for your God the Light.</hi> We do acknowledge, that we deſire no other God to be jealous for, nor to worſhip, reverence &amp; ſerve, then the ſame God who is Light, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. the God of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. but we know the Scoffer, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, Slanderer, Proud &amp; Ambitious Man, hath another God he is jealous of, and afraid to looſe, and ſuch the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Will curſe their God, when they ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold nothing but Darkneſs and Trouble.</hi> Take heed, <hi>W.

               <p>In page 92. <hi>Thou counts the</hi> Quakers <hi>honeſt, civil</hi> Heathens.</p>
               <p>Well then, <hi>William,</hi> for Honeſty and Civility Sake &amp; as we are Babes in Chriſt too, as thouſay'ſt, do not ſlander us nor revile us ſo any more, nor call us ſuch Blaſphemers as thou haſt done, ſaying, <hi>This is the fifth time of</hi> Bayly's <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> &amp;c. calling to thy Reader to know, <hi>If his Ears do not tingle at theſe Rampant Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> p. 94.

               <p>And in p. 98. thou cryeſt, <hi>O that thou hadſt but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood this one great Place of Scripture</hi> (after thou hadſt perverted it) <hi>thou wouldſt never have turned</hi> Quaker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W.

               <p>And how doſt thou ruſh into Lies, and Perverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my Words and the Scriptures alſo in thy 99th and 100th pages of thy Book, as if thou hadſt learnt of thy Brother <hi>T.

               <p>But I have conſidered, that the Lord God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven doth permit the Dragon to caſt out his Floods after the true woman, as <hi>John</hi> ſew, and that Hell hath opened, and is opening her Mouth in Blaſphemies, and the Devil hath great wrath, knowing he hath but a ſhort time; but VVo be to you, ye Earthly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants among whom the Devil is thus come down in Rage againſt an Innocent People; it were better you had never been born, then to be found in this work, oppoſing the Glorious Appearance of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Son of God, who will not hear your crying <hi>Lord Lord,</hi> while <hi>VVorkers of Iniquity,</hi> [mark that] but muſt depart to the left hand, into the Lake that burns forever and ever.</p>
               <p>And moreover, I tell you, That our Armour of Light is ſo good a Defence unto us, that all the fiery Darts of the Wicked do not enter us, but into your own Bowels, as its written, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.12,13,14,15.</p>
               <p>Pag. 109. thou ſayſt (of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Light) <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that live not up to this Light, will be very inexcuſably Condemned.</hi>

               <p>So now read thy groſs Abſurdity and Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction rightly thus, (viz.) <hi>Many that live not up to the Fleſh, will be very inexcuſably condemned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doſt not thou now ſee how thou contradicteſt thy ſelf, and the Apoſtle alſo, who ſaid, <hi>If ye live af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fleſh, ye ſhall dye, &amp;c?</hi> How doth thy Envy againſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> blind thee! But this is but a touch of them, which may be gathered and put in the rank of thy Confuſion ere long. And thou calleſt it <hi>corrupt Nature,</hi> and contradicteſt again the plain Scripture, holding, <hi>Chriſt dyed not for All,</hi> pag. 125.</p>
               <p>And then I mentioning <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. [<hi>By Mercy and Truth Iniquity is purged</hi>] thou pretendeſt, thou art afraid I am a <hi>down-right Papiſt.</hi> As much Ground to ſuſpect <hi>Solomon</hi> thou haſt as me, for they are his words.</p>
               <p>And in pag. 127. (where I mentioned the People of God's Trembling and Quaking) thou wiſheſt <hi>for my own Credit ſake I had forborn thoſe Lines.</hi> I know thou likeſt not Quaking &amp; Trembling (though it ſhall be thy Portion ere long) But I wiſh thou hadſt forborn thy multitude of Lyes and Slanders, Scoffs, Perverſions, Falſe Accuſations and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions; for it would have been more for thy Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit among men, much more as thou art a Teacher of others, and much more to thy Soul's Peace; for they will be thy heavy Burthen in the End.</p>
               <p>And as for thy <hi>Queries,</hi> pag. 128. (viz.) <hi>Did you
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40871:54"/> ever hear the Voice of God? or, have you any Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Viſion or Revelation, &amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Yes, <hi>William,</hi> we have; and if thou haſt not heard his Voice, nor haſt no Immediate Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion &amp; Revelation, &amp;c. thou art not fit to be a Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of others, neither canſt thou be a true Miniſter of the Goſpel, if thou declare not what thou haſt ſeen and heard of God: But this ſhews thy Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in thoſe weighty Matters, and that thou haſt run, and the Lord hath not ſent thee, like thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of old, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.21. &amp; 29.8.9.</p>
               <p>And pag. 129. thou feigneſt a Prayer for me, as if thou beganneſt to be weary of down-right Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of me; but that will not cover thy Nakedneſs and Wickedneſs in the Sight of God or Men. What, <hi>William!</hi> is the third, fourth and fifth time of <hi>Bayly's Blaſphemies, groſs and damnable Errors, Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green, Poyſon, Plague, Venom, Leproſie, Wounding &amp; Death</hi> (with abundance more of ſuch like through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thy Book) all turned to, <hi>O Lord, let not the Goſpel be hid from this Man, &amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely were thy Heart and Mind changed ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, as thy deceitful Tongue ſeems to be, it would be well for thee, and a Place of Repentance might yet be found for thee. But I never read, that the Prayers of a Lyar and Scoffer, an Envious, Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Slandering Tongue availed with the Lord; but on the contrary, That the effectual fervent Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a Righteous Man avails much, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16.</p>
               <p>W. H. why doſt thou ſtill pervert and abuſe my words? Shall I never ſee one Page of thy Book emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40871:54"/> of ſuch things, from the one end to the other: Thou mightſt well call it a <hi>full</hi> Reply; for I never ſaw a Book fuller of thoſe unſavoury and vile things, which manifeſteth thy Emptineſs of that which is Good, Grave and Savoury, the Ornaments of a True Chriſtian Miniſter.</p>
               <p>How dareſt thou ſay, that I called the Light <hi>the Blood of Chriſt, or the Blood that cleanſeth,</hi> as in the 139th page of thy Book? let the Reader ſee that 43d page of my Book thou quoteſt, where my words are theſe, <q rend="inline margQuotes">But the precious Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, as of Lamb without Spot and Blemiſh, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18,19 &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And where did I call the Light (that every man hath) the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>Holy City,</hi> W. H. as thou ſayeſt in the lower end of page 139. Are not my very plain words theſe (p. 45.) <hi>viz.</hi>) <q rend="inline margQuotes">And God is confounding this great City (<hi>Babylon</hi>) and ſetting up his Holy City upon a Hill, which cannot be hid, whoſe Light is like a Jaſper, clear as Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Is not here ſufficient Diſtinction between the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the Light of the City? let the Reader judge. But what is it thou wilt not do to render us odious? But thy Refuge of Lyes muſt fall upon thy own head. Who would but have thought even now (when thou began'ſt thy Prayer for me) but that thou hadſt been almoſt weary of belying me &amp; perverting my words? but I doubt thou art ſo accuſtomed to it, that it will be hard for thee to leave it; however, I muſt mind thee of thy Portion from the Hand of the juſt pure God (if thou goeſt on, and Repenteſt not ſpeedily)
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40871:55"/> it will be, to be ſhut out of the Holy City, as thou mayeſt read <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.15. &amp; 21.8. among them that love and make Lyes. Therefore be warned in time, before the Trumpet ſounds, <hi>He that is filthy, let him he filthy ſtill: and he that is holy, let him be holy ſtill: for Time ſhall be no longer.</hi> This is in Love to thy Soul, whether thou hear or forbear.</p>
               <p>This, in ſhort, I return thee as an Anſwer to thy full Reply.</p>

               <head>Now a few Words in Reply to Thee <hi>William Dimſdale.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Beginning to view thy part of the Book, find thee ſoon complaining of hard Titles given thee by us, which we deſire the moderate Readers to judge of; for, in what thou doſt ignorantly againſt the Truth and us, we can ſay, <hi>The Lord forgive thee;</hi> but what thou doſt wilfully and perverſly, its <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi> for which the Lord will rebuke thee. How do you one while Commend the Light, and by and by Revile it? as for inſtance, p. 109. compared with pag. 113. and 135. where <hi>W. H.</hi> calls it <hi>fallen blind Nature;</hi> and pag. 109. ſaith, <hi>Many that live not up to this Light will be very inexcuſably condemned;</hi> and yet condemns and reviles them that endeavour to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40871:55"/> live up or according to it; and blaſphemouſly calls the true Light, that is in Man, that Chriſt Jeſus hath given (which lighteth every man that cometh into the World, <hi>John</hi> 1.9.) <hi>Corrupt Nature, Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>Fallen Blind Nature.</hi> Theſe hard Speeches will come heavier upon you then the Titles ye complain of, in the Day of your Account.</p>
               <p>And in pag. 143. thou ſayeſt, <hi>It checks for Sin, as in</hi> Adam <hi>after the Fall,</hi> Gen. 3.10. <hi>which is the Voice of God to him,</hi> as the Reader may ſee in that place.</p>
               <p>And ſhould not the Voice of God be obeyed by all the Children of men, which cauſeth <hi>Fear and Dread, and Senſe of Shame to ſeize upon a man, becauſe of Puniſhment — that he hath not Power to go on in Sin,</hi> as thou acknowledgeſt <hi>through the Reproof of this Light,</hi> p. 143. which in the page before thou calleſt, the <hi>Covenant of Works;</hi> and in pag. 146. thou ſayſt, <hi>Chriſt giveth Light to all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So its <hi>Chriſt's Gift; God's Voice, which keeps from going on in Sin, by which a man may know ſome Divine things; a Spark remaining in fallen man, in every mar, of that Light that</hi> Adam <hi>had in a full Flame before his Tranſgreſſion, in his time of Innocency, &amp;c.</hi> Mark this, Reader; this is theſe mens Confeſſion of the Light that lighteth every man, and ſay, <hi>Its true in its kind.</hi> And then again, of the ſelf-ſame ſay, <hi>Its but Fleſh, corrupt Nature, fallen blind Nature, Impure, an unſound Thing, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then this follows, That full Flame that was in <hi>Adam</hi> before Tranſgreſſion, in his time of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, of which there is a Spark in every fallen man; that Voice of God, that reproveth for Sin, and keeps
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40871:56"/> from going on in Sin, by which ſome Divine Things may be known; the Gift of Chriſt, &amp;c. which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a Change in the Life and Converſation (p. 150.) is but <hi>Corrupt Nature, Impure, Unſound Fleſh, Fallen Blind Nature</hi> [Oh! groſs.]</p>
               <p>Now, putting their blind Contradictions nearer together, ye may read them thus, (viz.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Light in every man is true in its Kind:</hi> NO, <hi>its an Unſound Thing. Its the Voice of God to</hi> Adam, Gen. 3.10. NO, <hi>its but Corrupt Nature. Its that</hi> Adam <hi>had in a full Flame in his time of Innocency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Tranſgreſſion:</hi> IT IS <hi>but Fleſh, and impure Fleſh too. But it teacheth the things contained in the Law, and works a Change in the Life and Converſation: Its but Fallen Blind Nature doth all this. It ſheweth ſome Divine Things, and reproves for Sin, and Chriſt giveth Light to all, &amp;c.</hi> That which ſheweth Divine Things, and reproveth for Sin, is but <hi>Blind Fallen Nature, Impure, Corrupt and Unſound Fleſh, which</hi> Adam <hi>had in a full Flame in his time of Innocency, before Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W. H.</hi> The laſt time I laid your Contradictions and Confuſions before you, thou calledſt it, <hi>A Wild-Gooſe-Chaſe,</hi> ſuch as thou hadſt not ſeen <hi>a more ſtrange, &amp;c.</hi> Truly its you two that I am now again tracing, as I did then; and if you will call your ſelves <hi>Wild-Geeſe</hi> I cannot help that: but I never ſaw ſuch a heap of Confuſion and Contradictions from any that were Tame, or well in their Wits, which will, I believe, ſeem ſtrange to ſome that think thee a wiſer man: The Wildneſs is your own, in running o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and under, and round about in the Dark, not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40871:56"/> being able to comprehend the true Light, which lighteth every man, &amp;c. but give ſtrange Names to it like Diſtracted Blind Men about Colours: What wouldſt thou ſay, if a piece of White Cloth ſhould be laid down on a Table, and two Men ſhould come into the Houſe, and one ſhould ſay its <hi>Black,</hi> and the other its <hi>Green,</hi> and then change their Minds, and both ſay its <hi>Blue</hi> and <hi>Red;</hi> what wouldſt thou think of theſe Men, ſeeing the Piece is as unchangeably <hi>white</hi> as the Light? Wouldſt thou not think or believe they were either Fools, Blind, Mad or Diſtracted, or given up to believe and tell Lyes? Judge thee.</p>
               <p>I have not parallel'd you with <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as you have the <hi>Quakers;</hi> but I leave the Reader (with the Light of Chriſt in his Conſcience) to read you and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare you.</p>
               <p>Again, pag. 147. (after thy blind Conſtructions about the Light) ſayeſt thou, W. D. <hi>That Light that ſhewed</hi> Adam <hi>that he had broke the Law of God,</hi> Gen. 3. <hi>did not ſhew unto him the way of Deliverance, but God ſhewed it unto him by Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How wilt thou prove that, ſeeing its already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, it was the Voice of God to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. when he had ſinned, &amp;c. Diſtinguiſh between the Immediate Voice of God and Revelation here if thou canſt; elſe all thy Labour to undervalue the true Light is in vain.</p>
               <p>Could <hi>Adam</hi> ſee a Way of Deliverance without Light? And is not God (that ſpoke to <hi>Adam</hi>) Light? and doth not his Voice reveal? what reveals then, if not God by his Voice? who ſhewed <hi>Adam</hi> his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs?
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40871:57"/> and who ſhews unto man his Thoughts? <hi>Amos</hi> 4.13.</p>
               <p>Doth not one man reveal or declare his Mind to another when he ſpeaks to him? if not, what doth it ſignifie? conſider it, and then ſee thy Perverſion of <hi>John</hi>'s words chapter 3.6. as if he ſpoke of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Light, and called it Fleſh; and then look back into thy own Confuſion about it, ſaying, <hi>It teacheth the Things contained in the Law,</hi> and yet counts it <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,</hi> as I have ſhewed already; this is your <hi>Wild-Gooſe Chaſe</hi> ye like not to hear of; but as I told you laſt time, your Folly muſt be made manifeſt, as <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi>'s was, that withſtood <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In page 149. thou ſayeſt, <hi>I ſcarce know one Goſpel-Truth, but this common Light contradicteth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And yet confeſſeſt, <hi>It works a Change in the Life and Converſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I thought that work had not been contradictory to the Goſpel, which was to be adorned with a Blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and Holy Converſation, in the Apoſtles Dayes, who ſaid, <hi>God was Light</hi> and Chriſt, who gives Light to all, as thou ſayeſt.</p>
               <p>But why, <hi>W. Dimſdale,</hi> doſt thou teach People to deny the great progreſs they have made by doing Good and abſtaining from Evil (which is of uſe in its Place, as thou haſt ſaid) p. 154. <hi>And to deny all they think is of Chriſt in them?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Is not this well-pleaſing to the Devil and wicked men, thinkeſt thou, Reader? and then he ſaith, <hi>I know thou wilt count it a notorious Lye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou mighteſt have ſaid, <hi>Notorious Wickedneſs;</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:40871:57"/> for it is Wickedneſs much to be taken notice of, to deny all that I think is of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in me, as thou would have me do in point of Juſtification; is it not God that juſtifieth? and did not <hi>Paul</hi> think he had the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God?</hi> 1 Cor. 7.40. and did not that Spirit juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. and bear witneſs with their Spirits, that they were the Children of God? is this nothing to Juſtification, to have God's Spirit wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for me? and is not God Light and his Spirit too? muſt I deny all this now? let the wiſe in Heart judge, if this be not to deny God and Chriſt Jeſus, and the Spirit; and in the ſame page ſayeſt, viz. <hi>But apply thy ſelf to the Glaſs of the Law; for by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin.</hi> So here I muſt deny all that I think is of Chriſt in me, the Light, Life and Peace within me (as he ſaith) and apply my ſelf to the Glaſſe of the Law, &amp;c. O ſtrange Doctrine! where are ye now, ye <hi>Babylonians,</hi> who have ſo much cryed out againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> for bringing People to the Bondage of the Law and Covenant of Works? What! are you now come to be Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Law, not knowing what ye ſay, nor whereof ye affirm? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5,6,7. But the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> know what they ſay, and do affirm with <hi>John,</hi> (that great Prophet) that That was the True Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the World, <hi>John</hi> 1.9. though you ſay, <hi>Its Corrupt Nature &amp; Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Blind Nature, and Impure, Fleſh, and an Unſound Thing.</hi> I never heard any Man of God call it by ſuch Vilifying Names as ye do; ſuch Confuſed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as I have not heard of, but from you, like that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40871:58"/> again in pag. 156. where thou ſayeſt, <hi>Our State is ſure and certain on God's part, his Foundation is ſure, yet as to us its brittle, and very uncertain, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What! have you a little Fear then, that you may loſe your Salvation now? if you have, you are brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle indeed; for you ſeem very contrary in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſometimes, as, witneſs the Tenure of both your Books.</p>
               <p>But thou ſayeſt in the ſame page, <hi>The one Half of your ſelves warring againſt the other,</hi> (viz.) <hi>the Fleſh againſt the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VVhere do you find the Spirit called Half a Man's Self?</p>
               <p>You having denyed the true Light, and called it Fleſh, and Corrupt Nature, &amp;c. this muſt go with that Half that wars againſt the Spirit; ſo Fleſh and the Light being denyed by you, ye will be left as bare and naked in the dark as indeed your Confuſed Brittle Work hath rendred you in the Eyes of ſuch as fear the Lord.</p>
               <p>And in pag. 157. thou ſayeſt again, (viz.) <hi>That all men are lighted by a Light that is true in its Kind, by Jeſus Chriſt, as he was the Creator of all things, I deny not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now mark the Kind of this true Light, as theſe men have interpreted and affirmed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is True in its Kind; then True, Corrupt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Light, True, Fallen, Blind Nature and Fleſh:</hi> For theſe are the Kinds and Denominations you have placed on the True Light, that lighteth every man that cometh into the World, <hi>John</hi> 1.9. And you
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40871:58"/> ſhall never get from under the Guilt of Blaſphemy againſt God, without ſpeedy Repentance, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of your Evil herein, as publickly as you have ſpread theſe your Errors; <hi>The Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for all thy Arguments for being a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and W. H's digging deep to bring forth this Lying Wonder; its all in vain, as I have ſhewed at the beginning of this Treatiſe: for he, nor thee, nor any other, can never prove nor manifeſt, that thou waſt ever ſuch a <hi>Quaker</hi> as he hath affirmed; though (as I ſaid) I believe thou waſt convinced of ſome Sins, as thou acknowledged, and waſt kept from <hi>ſtealing Herrings, and doing wrong to thy Neighbour,</hi> &amp;c. but not went <hi>farther</hi> then <hi>moſt</hi> of them, &amp;c. nor was <hi>fully</hi> of their Way, Spirit, Faith and Principle; and ſo, in ſtriving againſt the Truth, you do but manifeſt to the World your Ignorance, Error, Confuſion, Enmity and Blindneſs; and ſo the farther ye ſtretch your ſelves upon this Bed, the ſhorter it will be, and the more your Nakedneſs will appear, and your Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering will be too narrow.</p>
               <p>And though you (and all wicked men) call the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principle <hi>Rotten, Unſound, Groſs</hi> and <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, &amp;c.</hi> yet we can bleſs the Lord for its Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and its Sound Doctrine; for it was the firſt, and will be the laſt upon the Earth; and it will not only keep from Stealing, and Wronging of Neighbours, but it will teach to Love Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us, and what elſe the Lord doth require of us: And its
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40871:59"/> ſo ſound and durable, that it will laſt, and be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, eſtabliſhed and magnified, and ſtand, when all your airy Smoke of Enmity, Oppoſition, Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Darkneſs ſhall come to an end, and be ſwept from off the Face of the Earth: <hi>The Lord God</hi> (<hi>who breathed into Man the Breath of Life</hi>) <hi>hath ſpoken it,</hi>

                     <p>HOw do you reliſh this Doctrine? he affirmeth, <hi>That the thorow work of Regeneration, which brings a Man into God's Kingdom of Glory, is not ſufficient for Man's Salvation;</hi> though this cannot be without True Juſtifying Faith in the Son of God, by virtue whereof this Work is wrought in the heart. Yet he ſaith, this is not ſufficient for Salvation, but call this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40871:62"/> Work of Chriſt <hi>Legal Righteouſneſs;</hi> therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes the Perfection of the Work of Chriſt, what he did for us in the Dayes of his Fleſh, and at his Death, and the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of that One Offering and Blood that was ſhed for us, and was for the perfecting of the Sanctified Ones, that ſo they might be brought into the Everlaſting Kingdom of his Glory, in which is Peace, Compleating and Perfection, Union and Communion with God in Chriſt Jeſus; and ſo this man ſpeaks unadviſedly with his Lips, and his Ignorance of the Work is the Ground of his Miſtake.</p>
                     <p>Again, what do you ſay to this Doctrine of his? viz. <hi>That the Light within,</hi> that diſcovers all manner of Sin, yea, the Secret Sins of the Heart, or whatever Sin he committeth, he ſaith, <hi>This Light is altogether Darkneſs,</hi> yea, he ſaith, <hi>It is Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>before a man be convinced, he hath nothing in him but Fleſh;</hi> the Light afore mentioned, he ſaith, is altogether Darkneſs, and Fleſh; but ſome of you are of a better Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this matter, and have ſaid to me, and before <hi>William Haworth,</hi> that it would bring a man under the Senſe of Sin, and condemn him for it; ſo that it ſeems, ſome of you begin to grow wiſer then your Teacher; and I pray God, that you may go on to encreaſe in that which is good daily, and know the Lord God and his Spirit to teach you, and not to depend upon ſuch an Unlearned Man as this, in the things of God; for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, the <hi>Law</hi> was <hi>Spiritual,</hi> but he was <hi>Carnal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, he ſaith, <hi>That Thouſands in the World are this Day condemned by the Lord, yet notwithſtanding are not condemined for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> So, it ſeems there are a People in the World whoſe Unbelief ſhall not be charged upon them, yet muſt be condemned. Now, was not Unbelief the very Ground-Sin of the whole. World, who are in the <hi>Firſt Adam,</hi> and the Inlet into all manner of Vice and Debauchery? and being clear from the Sin of Unbelief, he is in the Way to obtain Freedom from all manner of Sin whatſoever, and it may not touch him at all, neither he be condemned at all; And I have underſtood, that the Goſpel Sound had ſpread through the Earth, and it is an Everlaſting Sound this Day ſounded in the Ears of all People,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40871:63"/> calling to Repentance, &amp; Dependance upon the Eternal God in Chriſt for Salvation; and the ſtopping the Ear from hearing this glorious Goſpel-ſound, not believing in the Light of Chriſt Jeſus the true Light, that lighteth every man coming into the world, to be the Ground of Condemnation. Now I ſay, I had thought, this Unbelief had been the ſame Ground of all mens Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as they are in the firſt diſobedient <hi>Adam,</hi> or Earthly Man, but all Sinners are not in that State by <hi>William Haworth</hi>'s Doctrine, ſhut up in Unbelief, and therefore there is another way of Condemnation for them, then that of not believing in Chriſt the Light; but he is blind indeed that ſees not this man's Ignorance and Confuſion in the things of God.</p>
                     <p>Again Friends, this he told me in the hearing of <hi>Jeremiah Suift,</hi> and another man, <hi>That God ordained People to be wicked before they were born,</hi> which I called <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> and ſurely you that are ſober will be aſhamed of him, that is thus full of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and Ignorance; but he fell very furiouſly upon me in the End, and thruſt me out of his Chamber, becauſe I would have endeavoured his Welfare, and reclaimed him from his Errors; I am ſure I had no other End in my Heart, but he hath manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Spirit of his Maſter <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and may be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch as are wicked and hypocritical; though he profeſs Liberty of Conſcience, I believe no ſuch thing from him, &amp; ſuch of his Spirit, but that he would ſoon (I have good Ground to believe) follow his Brethren of <hi>New-England,</hi> in a Murderous Spirit; I pray God bleſs you that are ſober People, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you to himſelf, that you may proceed in your Enquiry after that which is Good, and the Lord of Heaven keep you is the Prayer of him that loves you.</p>

               <p>Much I could write of this Man, but I ſpare him at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, only thus much lay on my Conſcience to preſent to you at this time; but if Occaſion be, I could preſent you with a great deal of his wicked Lying and Baſeneſs, full of Confuſion and Darkneſs, far unlike a Chriſtian or Miniſter of Chriſt, but a Feigned Hypocrite, a Light, Vain Man, a Drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40871:63"/> and Imaginer of the things of God, having a patcht-up thing of an Imperfect form of Godlineſs, but ignorant of the Power.</p>

               <p>This was writ long ſince, and only one Copy of it given to <hi>Jeremaih Suift,</hi> and his Brethren to peruſe, &amp;c. And my Charge ſtands good againſt him, that he affirmed as above ſaid, <hi>That God ordained people to be wicked before they were born,</hi> and I do ſolemnly affirm, he ſpoke it, let him bring what witneſſes he can to the contrary, I am ſure they may be falſe ones in this matter; it was not gathered up by me againſt him, as a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his Doctrine, or any thing of that Nature, but he plainly affirmed the thing, viz. <hi>That God ordained People to be wicked before they were born:</hi> And whereas he daringly ſaith, <hi>If I dare come to the Tryal,</hi> he offers two Subſtantial Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to prove, that I ſaid, <hi>The Doctrine of Election was a Devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, Damnable and Blaſphemous Doctrine,</hi> and alſo to prove, that <hi>No ſuch thing was ſaid by him, as, that God ordained People to be wicked before they were born;</hi> and if I pleaſe, he will enter the <hi>Liſts</hi> with me, and the like. I anſwer, That my God is the Living God, above all the falſe Gods; whom I ſerve and reverence, &amp; in his Name and Power he hath kept me hitherto, over the Heads of ſuch Gilded Hypocrites as thou art; and I fear not to meet thee, nor thy Maſter's Strength, and thy wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, in the Name of my God, in any convenient Place e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually agreed on, to manifeſt the Truth of my Cauſe, and to try thy Power; and I deny thy Spirit, who denies the Power and Heavenly Light of the true God and Chriſt, and callſt his Bleſſed Image and Saving Health, the Work of Regeneration, <hi>Legal Righteouſneſs,</hi> and a man's <hi>own Righteouſneſs:</hi> I tell thee, I deny thy Spirit and Work, and ſtand up for the true God, and his Chriſt, whom thou knoweſt not, but by Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, nor where he is, but by Imagination. Thou Dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, haſt thou not loſt the Sight of the true Saviour? and now
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40871:64"/> thou imagines the Place of his Reſidence thou knowſt not where, nor what thou ſayeſt, nor whereof thou affirmeſt; a Cloud hath received him out of thy Sight, and you are parted, if ever thou hadſt any Acquaintance with him in any Meaſure; and where he is thou canſt not ſee him with thy blind Eye, nor come unto him; for indeed the Heavens have received him, and the Heavenly Hoſt ſee him, but thou ſhalt never ſee him to thy Comfort, but Condemnation, in that Dark and Wicked Mind thou liveſt in, profeſs what thou wilt, and babble what thou canſt in a vain Mind: Thou wouldſt be diſputing about the Body of Jeſus, where it is, and what it is, but thou canſt not find it out, no more then the Devil could, in diſputing with the Angel about the Body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and thou art ſufficiently anſwered elſewhere, as to that.</p>
               <p>Surely the Apppearance &amp; Sight of Chriſt will be to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, who believe in thy Doctrine of <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> in denying the Light within to be Spiritual and Chriſtian; for as the Devils ſaw him, and knew him, and were tormented by him, in the Dayes of his Fleſh, as accounting his Coming then, a Torment, tormenting them before the time; ſo ſhalt thou and thoſe of thy Spirit, except ye repent; for your Torments are begun already, and your Gnaſhing of Teeth, becauſe he is come to reign, and he muſt reign who is our Joy, and your Sorrow muſt encreaſe and have no End, who are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and mad in your oppoſing of him, in this Day of his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Appearance.</p>
               <p>The Subſtance of his Anſwer to my Poſtſcript is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Concerning <hi>Perſonal Reprobation,</hi> he affirmeth, <hi>That God willeth to permit Evil, by denying Grace which would prevent it.</hi> As much as to ſay, God having fore-ordained the greateſt part of the World to be Reprobated and Damned therefore to bring about his End, he denies the Means of their Salvation, that is, Grace, to the End that they may be damned; for they muſt be damned, there is no Remedy; why? Becauſe God hath ſo decreed before they be born, and this Purpoſe and Decree of his muſt ſtand, and it cannot be otherwiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40871:64"/> the Lord denieth them the Benefit of his Saving Grace.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Ely</hi> was puniſhed with Death, becauſe he reſtrained not his Sons Wickedneſs, and had not that Indignation againſt it as it deſerved; what would they make God to be who (as they ſay) reſtrains his Grace, becauſe he hath ordained them to Damnation, and alſo Chriſt did not dye for them, and ſo it is impoſſible for thoſe, for whom Chriſt did not dye, that they ſhould be ſaved; this is the natural Conſequence of ſuch a Doctrine, and ſo it is of the Devil, and to make the Lord the hardeſt of Maſters, and greateſt of Tyrants, to require that of man, which he hath decreed aforehand it ſhall be impoſſible for him to do, and yet he muſt for not doing it be condemned, as much as if a Tyrant ſhould firſt command a man's Legs to be cut off, and then command him to go, and kill him for not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or put out a man's Eyes, and then command him to ſee, and for diſobeying ſuch a Command, he muſt be ſlain: In like manner the Lord requires Faith and Repentance, where afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand he hath deprived him of Power to do either, on purpoſe to deſtroy him, becauſe he hath decreed him before he was born to ſuch an End, and therefore denyeth him Grace. Now, <hi>William Haworth,</hi> doſt thou believe, we can believe this to be Chriſtian Doctrine, which hath ſo much Contradiction and Confuſion in it? for the Grace of God hath certainly appeared to all men, according to Scripture; and the Invitation is unto all to believe in Chriſt that they may be ſaved, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Perſons. Thus in ſhort I leave this, and paſs on to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the reſt of thy Non-ſenſe and Confuſion, becauſe much hath been writ in this particular by other Hands, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Concerning <hi>Original Sin</hi> I ſaid, <hi>The Devil was the Original of Sin in Mankind,</hi> and that <hi>I underſtood not how In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fents could be guilty of Sin in the Womb, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this <hi>W. H.</hi> anſwers thus, <hi>That the Devil is the Original of Sin in Mankind</hi> (i. e.) <hi>The firſt Tempter to Sin, is a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine we learned from</hi> Moſes, <hi>not from the</hi> Quakers, <hi>but what is this</hi> ad rem? Ergo <hi>there is no Original Sin, except it be the Devil. Aſtrange Argument,</hi> ſaith he.</p>
               <p>Now Reader, mark this man's <hi>Logick,</hi> becauſe I ſaid, that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40871:65"/> the Devil alwayes was and is the Original of Sin in Mankind, who obey him, he makes this <hi>Ergo</hi> or Concluſion, <hi>There is no Original Sin, except it be the Devil;</hi> and ſo the Argument muſt ſtand thus, <hi>The Devil alwayes was and is the Original of Sin in Mankind, who obey him,</hi> Ergo, <hi>The Devil is Original Sin.</hi> What abuſive Non-ſenſe and Perverſion is this! But however, we ſay, the Devil is the Original of Sin; and now I ſhall look into the Scriptures he brings to prove the Sin of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in the Womb. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Rom. 5.12. <hi>Wherefore as by one man Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin, and ſo Death paſſed upon all men for that all have ſinned.</hi> Mark, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, what is this to Infants in the Womb, who have not yet ſinned? read the next verſe following, the latter part of it, viz. <hi>Sin is not imputed, where there is no Law;</hi> but where is the Law to Infants in the Womb, before they come into the World? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is none, therefore no Sin nor Condemnation, it muſt needs be an Innocent, Sinleſs State; ſo that the ſtate of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning muſt needs be in the World, not before they come into it: And as in the 14th verſe, <hi>Death reigning from</hi> Adam <hi>to</hi> Moſes, <hi>even over them, who had not ſinned after the Similitude of</hi> Adam's <hi>Tranſgreſſion, &amp;c.</hi> This thou wilt needs have to be Infants in the Womb; what groſs Darkneſs is this! How can Death reign over any until they come under the Dominion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of it, and ſo be Tranſgreſſors of a known Law, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Thought, Word or Deed? It is Non ſenſe and Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous: But Death hath reigned over many, who have not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after the Similitude of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion; for Death reigned over Drunkards, Swearers, Lyars, Sodomites, the Old Wicked World, Whoremongers; and many who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by other Names, which was not all a ſinning after the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion; for he was no <hi>Sodomite,</hi> Drunkard nor Swearer, Whoremonger nor Adulterer, that we read of: And ſo Death reigns over all Sinners, be the Similitude of ſinning what it will; but anſwer me, after what Similitude is the Child's ſinning? Is it after the Similitude or Likeneſs of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinning, or the Similitude of any other? And whereas thou querieſt how it comes to paſs that Death is inflicted upon
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40871:65"/> Infants, if they have no Sin? I anſwer, It cannot be for their Sin, becauſe they have none, and the Reaſon why they dye is becauſe they are Mortal, and muſt dye ſooner or later, even Mankind as well as other living things on Earth; but to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and True Believers in Chriſt Jeſus, this is no Sign of God's Diſpleaſure, but rather a Tranſlation into a better State, except thou reckons the State and Being in this Life, to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and Regenerate, better then that which is to come; and many holy men have had great Joy at their Departure: So that the Cauſe of the natural death cannot be, as is fooliſhly imagined, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned; for if he had not ſinned, he might have dyed, as to his natural Life, being of the Earth, made of the Duſt; and it was ſaid to him, <hi>In the Day thou eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thereof, thou ſhalt dye</hi> (mark in that Day) yet he lived after his Fall many Years, as to his natural Life, but he dyed ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually inſtantly upon his ſinning, even in that Day, and at that time. And as for thoſe other Scriptures thou bringeſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. <hi>And were by Nature Children of Wrath, as well as others.</hi> Gal. 2.15. <hi>We who are</hi> Jews <hi>by Nature, and not Sinners of the</hi> Gentiles; theſe Scriptures ſpeak of Children of Wrath, and <hi>Jews</hi> by Nature, and not Sinners of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> what is this to Infants in the Womb, who are no Sinners, neither can be Children of Wrath? Theſe Scriptures relate to a ſinful ſtate before Converſion, whether young or old; ſo that herein thou wreſts and abuſeſt the Scriptures, and this is plain for me to ſee with that bleſſed Light of Chriſt Jeſus, thou art an Enemy to.</p>
               <p>As I did, ſo I do affirm, Jeſus Chriſt to be the true Light and Saviour, who enlightneth every man that cometh into the World, with a Meaſure of his own Light; but <hi>W. H.</hi> is one that cannot endure this Light or the Reproof of it upon his Conſcience; but ſtill would call it ſomething otherwiſe then what it is, and quotes <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. which ſpeaks no ſuch thing, as that the Light within every man <hi>is nothing but the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>written in the Heart,</hi> or another while, <hi>No more then Nature,</hi> as he calls it, p. 17. whereas the Inward Law (or Light within) in all its Manifeſtations and Appearances alwayes came by Jeſus Chriſt, and contains in it, not only the Subſtance
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40871:66"/> of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, but Goſpel-Virtue and Power, the true Light that enlightneth every Man that cometh into the World, by Virtue of which Divine Light and Power within, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> obeyed the Lord ſpiritually, and were accepted in ſo doing, though they had not the Outward Law in the Letter; and ſet the Letter aſide, What Law is that, that is written in the hearts of People? muſt it not needs be the Law of Chriſt inward in the Heart and Conſcience, and ſo of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, that makes free from the Law of Sin and Death; and it was alwayes ſo, that the Doers of this Law (or Light within) in the Heart and Conſcience, were juſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. and thus was <hi>Abraham</hi> juſtified by Works, <hi>James</hi> 2.21. when he had faithfully offered up his <hi>Iſaac</hi> upon the Altar in Obedience to God, it was a Good Work, by which he was juſtified in the Sight of God, who commanded, and he believed, and it was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs the Word of his Faith, by which he believed and knew the Will of God was the Light within we bear Teſtimony unto, which was before <hi>Moſes</hi> was or <hi>Abraham</hi> was; he that hath an Ear to hear let him hear but this Man's Underſtanding is ſhallow ſure, who one while ſaith, <hi>This Light in Man, is nothing but the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>written in the Heart,</hi> another while, <hi>It is no more then Nature;</hi> and what Nature? <hi>But a Guilty, Defiled Nature,</hi> p. 17. Oh ſad Confuſion! And muſt the Work of this Inward Light and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God be no more then <hi>Legal Righteouſneſs?</hi> and Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <hi>Legal Righteouſneſs,</hi> and a man's <hi>own Righteouſneſs?</hi> which is as great an Error as a man can utter: It is true, that by the bare Works of that Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> never man was juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before the Lord, or made Righteous; for if that could have made the Comers thereunto perfect, there had been no need of Faith in Chriſt the Light to have received Power, but that could not do, though great Strictneſs might be uſed in the outward Obſervance of thoſe outward things and Shadows, and through ſuch outward Conformity they might appear Righteous before man, yet this was but that outward Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> in like manner as now <hi>W. H.</hi> and ſuch as he, who ſeem to be very zealous for the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40871:66"/> Goſpel, and the Body of Jeſus, yet deny his Light and Power of God within with as much Violence, as ever the <hi>Phariſees</hi> denyed Chriſt Jeſu; at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be the Son of God; and they are in the Steps of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in their own ſelf Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and Profeſſion of the Goſpel without the true Power of Godlineſs, let the Heavenly Light which they ſo wickedly blaſpheme, be Judge in the Caſe, even in their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and yet they will Hypocritically acknowledge Chriſt is <hi>All in all,</hi> and <hi>all Power and Judgment is committed to the Son Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and then they cry this down again, and call it <hi>A natural Light</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> which judgeth mens Thoughts and Deeds of Darkneſs, and thus would rob Chriſt, both of his Authority and Judgment, to eſcape Judgment for Sin, Whileſt they imagine this Light within to be a natural Light, or <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> or what they pleaſe, a deviliſh wicked Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; for if ſo, then what need they care what they do, when there is nothing to judge them, but an <hi>Ignit fatuus,</hi> or a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Light? and ſo by this means they do what in them lieth to eſcape Judgment altogether, by imagining themſelves Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Believers, in a State of Sin; but we ſay, that Light which you ſcorn, and blaſpheme, and undervalue, and ſet at nought, will one Day bring the Flames of God upon you, and be as a Thouſand Witneſſes againſt you, becauſe of your Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poeriſie and Self-Righteouſneſs, except ye repent.</p>
               <p>All the Scriptures thou bringſt againſt us are perverted by thee, and they do not in the leaſt prove what thou ſayeſt, viz. How that <hi>the Inward Work of the Spirit of the Lord in man, or the Work of Regeneration, is a man's own Righteouſneſs, &amp; Legal Righteouſneſs;</hi> for if the Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs of man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt not in the Work of Regeneration and the Work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, wherein doth it conſiſt? What will thy Ramble of Non-Senſe, and Perverſion of Scripture, and vain Profeſſion of Chriſt avail thee? ſaying, Abraham<hi>'s Works done in the Spirit were not ſufficient,</hi> contrary to <hi>James</hi> 2.21. <hi>Was not</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>our Father juſtified by Works, when he had offered</hi> Iſaac <hi>his Son upon the Altar?</hi> Read alſo the next verſe, <hi>Seeſt thou how Faith wrought with his Works, and by Works was Faith made

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40871:67"/> this man bears ſalfe Witneſs by his Lyes and Blaſphemies, as any who are truly <hi>Chriſtians</hi> may eaſily perceive.</p>
               <p>As for thy quoting <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6. where thou ſayeſt, <hi>Even as</hi> David <hi>alſo diſcribeth the Bleſſedneſs of the Man unto whom God imputed Righteouſneſs without Works; what Works?</hi> (ſayſt thou) <hi>done by the Spirit ſurely; for ſuch were</hi> David<hi>'s Works, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto which I anſwer: That <hi>David</hi>'s Bleſſedneſs conſiſted in that the Lord God forgave him his Sins, and pardoned his Iniquities freely upon his unfeigned Repentance, and ſo he was received in Mercy; ſo read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. to the 6th verſe, and there it is plain, that Forgiveneſs, and Remiſſion, and Non-imputation of Sin, was to that Man in whoſe Spirit there was no Guile; which Guileleſs State was effected by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord, which he calls <hi>Legal Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>a Man's Own Righteouſneſs;</hi> and ſo this Perverter of Scripture goes about to prove, that the Works of the Spirit of the Lord, even the beſt of them, are ſinful, and blaſphemes the Goſpel-Power and Spirit, and may as well and as confidently call Chriſt an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

But according to this Man's Doctrine theſe Scriptures muſt be read thus, <hi>There is Condemnation to ſuch as walk after the Spirit of the Lord; and they are in this Work and Exerciſe chargeable with Iniquity, becauſe their beſt Works, performed by the Spirit of God, are ſinful, and as rotten Rags, and a Man's own Righteouſneſs, and Legal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> And again, <hi>He that ſoweth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap Condemnation, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>So, Reader, obſerve that he goes about to prove, that the Works of the Spirit and Power of the Lord are Legal, and a Man's Own Righteouſneſs, and effect nothing but Self-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and ſinful Obedience in a man's beſt Works, where they are wrought and done by this Spirit of the Lord.</p>
               <p>And again, he brings <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 64.6. to prove it, where the Prophet there ſaith, in the Perſon of the Wicked Nation, for which Wickedneſs and Hypocriſie God had brought &amp; would bring his ſevere Judgments upon them; ſaith he, <hi>We are all as an unclean thing, and all our Righteouſneſs are as Filthy Rags, and we all do fade as a Leaf, and our Iniquities like the Wind have taken us away.</hi> Mark, <hi>W. H.</hi> goes about from this Scripture, to prove that this Righteouſneſs the Prophet calls as Filthy Rags, was Spiritual Righteouſneſs, or wrought by the Spirit of the Lord; for he ſaith, <hi>Did not</hi> Iſaiah <hi>obſerve</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes<hi>'s Law in the ſpirit? and yet in that place of</hi> Iſaiah <hi>calls it fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Rags, as to Juſtification.</hi> This Man is wicked ſure, and wilfully blind and ſottiſh, who thus goes about to pervert the Scriptures ſo manifeſtly; for <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in that place is confeſſing the Sins of thoſe Times and People, and the Hypocritical Righteouſneſs of ſuch a People, who were wicked, whoſe Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities like the Wind had taken them away: What! were theſe Iniquities, which had taken them away, <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Works wrought in the Spirit? Oh abominable! And did ever any Prophet teſtifie againſt himſelf and the People for obſerving <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law in the Spirit? Nav; but he alwayes reproved their Wickedneſs and Hypocriſie. Read <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1. beginning at the 10th Verſe, and ſo through the whole Chapter, and there it is manifeſt, what Righteouſneſs the Prophet calls rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Regs, and was their Own Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Again, How wickedly he goeth on, and quotes <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22. <hi>I delight in the Law of God after the inward Man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Was not this to keep it in the Spirit? he kept it in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before his Converſion,</hi> Phil. 3. <hi>touching the Law blameleſs, and this he counted Loſs for Chriſt,</hi> verſ. 7. <hi>when he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:40871:68"/>
               <p>I anſwer, This man ſurely is fooliſh, and does not know what he ſaith, nor whereof he affirms, and is deſperate in his encounter againſt the Truth, right or wrong; or elſe could it be imagined he ſhould be ſo dark, that the Apoſtle ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count his delighting in the Law of God after the inward Man, after his Converſion, which was the Work of the Spirit of Chriſt, by which he was ſealed up to Eternal Life and Living Satisfaction; was it this he counted Loſs and Dung for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt? Then it muſt be read thus, <hi>The Heavenly Delight which I have through thy Grace in thy holy Law, I muſt caſt away as Abominable in thy ſight, as Loſs and Dung for the Excellency of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> What Non-ſenſe is this? And if ſo, then all Inward Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is to be quite gone as loſt, and parted with, and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt only put on, and nothing elſe left; for the comfortable Fellowſhip of the holy Spirit then is nautious and to be loathed, as Dung, and Chriſt's Fellowſhip and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionſhip muſt be parted with, as an Imagination, and a Dream or Fancy put on inſtead of it. Oh! abominable Doctrine, and miſerable perverting and wreſting of the Scripture; b t we confeſs, that <hi>Paul,</hi> after he came to behold the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Jeſus Chriſt, did account all his former Excellencies whatſoever, in his unconverted ſtate, but Dung and Loſs to be parted from for the Excellency of Chriſt, read <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. verſ. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, &amp;c. And ſurely his delighting in the Law of God after the inward Man, muſt needs be a large part of his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riencing this Excellency of Chriſt Je us.</p>
               <p>Again, My Charge was, <hi>That he affirmed the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation to be Legal Righteouſneſs, and a Man's Own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs:</hi> Unto which he hath given no poſitive Anſwer. And as for thy ſaying, thy Queſtion was, <hi>Whether the whole Chriſt was within me?</hi> and that I anſwered affirmatively; and thou ſayeſt, <hi>Thy aſſumption was then the Man Chriſt:</hi> to which thou ſayeſt I replyed, <hi>The Man Chriſt was;</hi> which amounts to thus much, That I affirmed the whole Chriſt was in me, God and Man.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Thy Tongue runs at random without Fear, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40871:69"/> Lyes thou wouldſt make thy Refuge; but I tell thee, the Lord will confound thee, and overtake thee with his ſwift judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to ſeal thee down in the Pit of Everlaſting Miſery, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou Repent. Canſt thou look me in the Face with this Lye in thy Mouth, that I affirmed, <hi>The whole Chriſt was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me?</hi> For Shame bluſh, and never profeſs Truth until thou knoweſt better how to ſpeak it: For I teſtifie againſt thee and thy Lyes and falſe Witneſs bearing againſt the Truth, The Fulneſs of the Godhead dwelt bodily in Jeſus, and he is the Head of his Body the Church, and is the Life of every Member, and the chiefeſt Member in this Body, which hath the chiefeſt Manſion in his Houſe, hath but received a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of that fulneſs that is in Jeſus: this I alwayes affirmed; and charge thee with profound and notable Lying and Belying the Truth; and what I anſwered to thy Queſtion, <hi>Whether the Man Chriſt Jeſus was in me?</hi> ſtands good, how that he was ſo in Meaſure ſpiritually; and ſo thou art an Enemy to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God and his Chriſt, and I have ſpared thee beyond thy Merits; for thou haſt deſerved before this time to have been made manifeſt more fully, becauſe of thy Prophaneneſs.</p>
               <p>And whereas in one place thou biddeſt the Reader, <hi>Judge, if I write not too much like an Innocent</hi> (that is in thy ſenſe, a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Fool,</hi> deprived of that Wiſdom and Underſtanding which ordinarily people are poſſeſſed withal) And the Ground of this Jeer from thee is, becauſe I plead for the Innocency of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in the Womb, whom with thy ſtanderous Tongue thou couldſt never yet faſten Guilt upon.</p>
               <p>Thou mayeſt remember <hi>William Ellis</hi> (that croſs <hi>Innocent,</hi> to uſe thy own Term) how like thou waſt unto him, who was frequently abuſed in the Streets by the rude Boys to make them Sport and Game, provoking him to Madneſs and Wrath, and ſo to ſtone them after a Wicked and Furious manner: How often when we were Priſoners together at <hi>Hartford,</hi> didſt thou bait this poor Frantick Creature, and make Sport with him for thy Pleaſure, and provoke him to Rage in my ſight, ſo that he hath furiouſly ſtoned thee? and in this thou haſt taken great Pleaſure. Now how like ſuch an Innocent, a Fool and Vile
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40871:69"/> Perſon didſt thou act, to make thy ſelf Sport with ſuch a Creature, how much unlike a Miniſter of Chriſt was ſuch vain and prophane Acting, to provoke ſuch a man, and ſtir him up to do Miſchief? And thou and <hi>Jeremiah Suift</hi> may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how furiouſly thou ran upon me when I told thee of it, and reproved thee for it in thy Priſon Chamber, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haſt thou threatned me, and told me, <hi>Thou couldſt ſpend thy Heart's Blood for the Goſpel, and that I deſerved to be beaten and cudgelled:</hi> and this when we meet to diſpute I ſhall prove to thy Shame and Diſgrace, thou foul-mouthed Creature, who art ſo far from <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> that thou art void of Common Civility: but however, if thou couldſt have ceaſed abuſing me in Print, I had not been thus publick, but buried this and much more that I have againſt thee in more ſilence; and thus much hath not been my Delight, but thy ſelf hath been the Cauſe of it.</p>
               <p>And whereas thou telleſt me of <hi>Curſing thee</hi> when in Priſon, that is another of thy Lyes to fill up thy meaſure and number of Wickedneſs; but I declared the Truth unto thee then, how that the Judgments and terrible Plagues of God would fall upon thee, except thou didſt Repent: This can <hi>William Fairman</hi> of <hi>Hartford</hi> teſtifie to be true, and I ſhall ſtand by it; and do tell thee again, Except thou Repent ſpeedily thou canſt not eſcape the Sentence of Eternal Judgment and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; and this is ſpoken to thee in Love to thy Soul, if thou canſt receive it; but however, I am clear of thy Blood if thou periſh, as ſure thou wilt, except thou Repent ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.</p>

               <p>It hath been ſaid, <hi>He that will make a good Souldier of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, againſt Errors, &amp;c. muſt, firſt conſcientiouſly ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the Chriſtian Art and Method of this Warfare, otherwiſe they may eaſily build up what they go about to throw down, and make</hi> Balaam<hi>'s haſte, who was ſent to curſe, and yet in Concluſion, bleſſed altogether.</hi> Numb. 24.10.</p>
               <p>Like Effects have ſtill attended ſuch malicious and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Undertakers, being too much of <hi>Jehu</hi>'s Temper, to be good Souldiers under Chriſt's Conduct; for that Spirit cannot endure to march againſt his Enemy with a Sober Pace, but had rather be toſſing <hi>Fire-Balls</hi> and <hi>Granadoes,</hi> then gently perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from <hi>Sound Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Good Experience,</hi> in the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Meekneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, <hi>Few men's Errors or Miſtakes</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>find Acceſs to their Judgments, but by the Way of their Affections; nor will it be eaſie for men to come at Errors, &amp;c. to diſthrone them, but by making their Approaches the ſame Way; I mean by making Friends of their Affections, that they may not ſide with their Judgments againſt them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is an Art</hi> (ſaith the ſame Author) <hi>as well of Compoſing Differences of Judgments, as far as Compoſure in this Kind may
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40871:70"/> with the Honour of Truth be admitted, as of Oppoſing that which is not meet to be admitted to Compoſition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But my <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> is not like to attain this Art, while he goes about to convince men by Falſe Accuſations, and Bad Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: I know no Reaſon why he ſhould ſo account me his Enemy (and ſuch a one, as he can ſcarce invent Names odious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to call me by, but alſo repreſents me not fit to be converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or eat and drunk withal) except it is becauſe I have told him the Truth without Flattery, and then it may be true according to the Latine Proverb, <hi>Obſequium amicos, veritas odiu on parit,</hi> (i.e.) <hi>Flattery gains Friends, Truth makes Foes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have not, knowingly, wronged him in any thing, and if it be thought I have dealt too ſharply, I deſire the Reader to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider my Provocation.</p>
               <p>My Inclination &amp; Temper is (as much as may be) to live in Peace and Love with all men, and therefore had not my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary's often boaſting and daring Invocations for my Anſwer (as I hinted to the Reader before) neceſſitated me to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication thereof, I ſhould have born all his Abuſes (if God had given leave) and in Silence have buried his whole Book, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Anſwer had lain ſo long by me.</p>
               <p>And whereas the man's Confidence in his own Abilities hath imboldned him to promiſe an Anſwer to whatever Queſtions I ſhould propound unto him, therefore</p>
               <p>Leſt either he ſhould think himſelf ſo perfectly inſtructed in all Points of Divinity, that nothing can be added to him; or all others ſo much below him, that he is able to reſolve all their Queſtions, whatever may be propoſed to him; I have inſtead of his thirty Queries to me (that I have anſwered) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded half the Number to him, if he think them either worth his Anſwer or Conſideration; they are as followeth.</p>
